Don't you think it's getting near your {LF}bedtime, ＠アルス＠＠?
Oh yeah, sorry!
Oh yeah, sorry!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}You'll stay on your best behavior {LF}this year, won't you?
Today's the Flower Festival. {LF}Your dad loves cherry blossoms.
Today's the Eating Contest. {LF}You going to enter it?
You did it, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}That's some appetite you have.
Too bad, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}There's always next time, though.
Today's the start of swimming season! {LF}Just be careful when you're playing in {LF}the water, okay?
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}You thinking of entering?
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}I used to love this contest when I {LF}was your age.
Sorry to hear you didn't win. {LF}Take this opportunity to learn {LF}something from it, though.
Today's the Dance Festival. {LF}You going to invite someone, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Big Cook-Off. {LF}I can't wait to see what you {LF}cook up!

Today's the Adventure Contest. {LF}Are you going to enter?
Congratulations, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}I had a feeling you'd win.
You must be disappointed. {LF}At least you didn't get injured, though.
Today's the Harvest Festival. {LF}Time for all of us to get together and {LF}give thanks for what we have.
Today's the Monster Contest. {LF}What kind of monsters do you like, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I always knew you were good with {LF}monsters, ＠アルス＠＠!
You lost, huh? {LF}You'll always be a winner to me.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}Are you going to invite someone, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
It might be kind of late at night {LF}for a kid your age, though.
Today's the Mining Contest. {LF}Are you going to take part, ＠アルス＠＠?
I'm not surprised you won, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}It must run in the family!
You'll always be number one in my {LF}book, kiddo.
Today's the last day of the year.{LF}I wish you a happy New Year,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}
Spring's a nice season, isn't it? {LF}One of my favorites.
Are you studying every day? {LF}Studying's very important.
I enjoy every chance we get to talk to {LF}each other, ＠アルス＠＠.
Whenever I think of summer I picture {LF}the ocean. That ocean breeze is so{LF}nice when it's hot out.
I may have built the school, {LF}but it's thanks to you that it's grown {LF}like it has, ＠アルス＠＠.
Have you made any new friends lately,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I like this time of year. {LF}Plenty of good eatin' to be had.
I love Fall! All the fruits of our{LF}labor pay off this time of{LF}year...literally!{LF}
I'd like for you, Mom, and me to all go {LF}somewhere on a vacation sometime.
All you need to do is look around you to {LF}know that winter's here!
Watch you don't catch a cold in this {LF}weather, ＠アルス＠＠.
It's been quite an eventful year, {LF}hasn't it? I'm just thankful to have{LF}you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh! Ya found it? Not bad, kid! {LF}Not bad at all. I'm startin' to {LF}like you! Ga ha ha!
A promise is a promise. Here ya go.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Tanya liked these. {LF}Is this for me?
Thanks! I love these!
Ugh...! That's the one thing{LF}I can't stand!
Thanks! I love these!
Ugh...! That's the one thing{LF}I can't stand!
Is this to drink? All right, then... 
I get the feeling you and me are gonna {LF}be good friends.
Is this to drink? All right, then... 
I get the feeling you and me are gonna {LF}be good friends.
I love those, but I would prefer one on {LF}my birthday.
Thanks! How'd you know today's my {LF}birthday? A ＠アイテム９＠...{LF}this is great!
I don't mean to sound ungrateful or {LF}anything, but you shouldn't be giving {LF}me so much on my birthday.
I love those, but I would prefer one on {LF}my birthday.
Thanks! How'd you know today's my {LF}birthday? A ＠アイテム９＠...{LF}this is great!
I don't mean to sound ungrateful or {LF}anything, but you shouldn't be giving {LF}me so much on my birthday.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Well, I won't turn you down, but I {LF}can't say I'm happy about it.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Well, I won't turn you down, but I {LF}can't say I'm happy about it.
I came to talk!
I came to buy!
Never mind... 
Before you do any buying, there's {LF}something I gotta tell you first.
When you get to the buy screen, {LF}on the left-hand side is your {LF}backpack, and on the right-hand side {LF}is what's for sale.
If you wanna buy something, all you {LF}gotta do is put it in your backpack, {LF}either with the A Button or the stylus.
Likewise, if you wanna sell something, {LF}move it from your backpack to the {LF}store's side.
A lot of things come in sets of 9. If {LF}you don't need that many, highlight {LF}the item and either press the A Button {LF}twice or touch it with the stylus twice.
That'll let you break it down.
Hold down the A Button to select{LF}a specific number of an item.{LF}You can't select a number over{LF}9, though!{LF}
You got all that?
Yep!
Uh, could you explain that again?
Welcome, friend! We got everything{LF}you need!
Spring Special
Summer Special
Fall Special
Winter Special
You come back now, y'hear?
Check out the deals on our spring {LF}seeds!
A man needs seeds for the summer! {LF}Not just one or two, either! {LF}Don't be shy about buying some!
Beautiful Fall, when all that work {LF}pays off. Be a man and buy {LF}some more seeds! Money shouldn't {LF}be an object here!
I know in winter you can't plant stuff{LF}at your farm, but there are all those{LF}other fields to plant in! If anything,{LF}you should buy more seeds now!
I always find myself oversleepin' in {LF}spring. Ga ha ha!
I can't stand all the heat we get in {LF}summer. Especially when I'm tryin' to{LF}sleep at night.
Fall's a good season for {LF}toughenin' you up. I do 1,000 pushups {LF}right when I get up and right before I {LF}hit the sack.
Mana always complains she's {LF}cold in winter, but I don't feel the {LF}cold one bit! Ga ha ha!
It's nice just takin' a walk 'round the {LF}park sometimes.
I feel like jumpin' right in the {LF}fountain in summer! Ga ha ha ha!
I always get to feelin' a little lonely {LF}this time of year.
We always had snowball fights {LF}whenever it snowed when I was a kid.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}What do you need at the clinic?
Nothin' beats a nice drink with good{LF}company! Ga ha ha!
Hey, where did you get that,{LF}anyway?
Have you been raiding my refrigerator,{LF}Douglas?
This clinic is one of the few places{LF}that stays nice and cool in the{LF}summer.
If you don't have anything to do here, {LF}would you mind hanging out somewhere {LF}else? This is a clinic.
Ha! I don't think she appreciates your{LF}company, Douglas. Ga ha ha!
Same goes for you, Gordon.
Hey Natalie, I hear a lot of people end {LF}up here in Fall from eating too {LF}much.
Only Herman. *sigh*
My stomach's made outta steel! {LF}Don't worry about me.
I can't imagine you two ever {LF}ending up here.
A lot of people hurt themselves in {LF}winter. Make sure you stretch and warm{LF}up your muscles properly before you{LF}start any hard work.
That's the first bit of sense I've heard {LF}out of your mouth in a while, Douglas.
You eat somethin' that didn't agree {LF}with ya?
I'll tell ya, nothing beats a good bath.
Baths are great in summer. {LF}Having a drink in Natalie's clinic {LF}after getting out is even better!
Baths are fantastic in Fall! {LF}If I ever open up another business, {LF}you can bet it'll be a bathhouse.
Baths feel best in the winter! {LF}The only downside is you gotta take{LF}'em indoors.
I like comin' to the church every now {LF}and then.
Gordon always gets on his high horse {LF}with his sermons. He wasn't always{LF}so holy, though. Why, back in the day,{LF}he got inta all sorts of trouble!
Don't go starting rumors among the {LF}children, Douglas!
Rumor? 'S the truth! Ga ha ha!
You'll never catch me listenin' {LF}to a dang sermon in the summer.
People come to listen in any weather{LF}because I give such fine sermons.
Eh, one a' life's mysteries, I guess.
If you gotta listen to one a' Gordon's {LF}sermons, I s'pose Fall's not a bad {LF}time to do it.
Faith shouldn't be seasonal. The{LF}soul needs nourishment no matter{LF}the season.
The weather might a' changed, but I {LF}see your sermons never stop.
That's what faith is about.
Time to get workin', kid!
This is my farm. No one's usin' it {LF}right now, so if you're up for it, {LF}knock yourself out, kid.
Came to see me, huh?
Yes.
Got somethin' ya wanna say to me?
Yes. I want to...I want to marry Mana.
You love 'er?
Yes.
Now how many times have I told you {LF}before? So long as I'm still walkin'{LF}this earth, ain't nobody marryin'{LF}my Mana!
O-Okay... 
Now, if you asked me, knowing that... {LF}that can only mean... 
You sayin' you're here to kill me, kid?!
No, of course not!
Course not? A man's gotta protect his {LF}woman. You don't beat me, {LF}you can forget about marryin' Mana!
Let's go, ＠カイル＠＠! You and me!
I-I'm not going to fight you...
That's no ordinary orc! That guy's huge!
Get back, Douglas!
You ain't got a chance against that {LF}thing!
It's okay, I'll handle it!
Well, all right, kid. Give it yer{LF}best shot!
You sure you're gonna be okay, ＠カイル＠＠?
＠カイル＠＠... 
Are you okay, Douglas?
That's the first time I seen you fight... {LF}Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.
Thanks... 
You'll make a fine husband for Mana.
Th-Thank you.
But don't you forget somethin'! {LF}You ever do anythin' to hurt my Mana, {LF}and we're gonna have more than {LF}words, boy!
Yes, sir!
Here, I want you to have this. {LF}It's a ring. Always did intend to give{LF}it to the man who was gonna marry Mana.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thank you.
Promise me you'll make Mana happy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I...I promise.
Good.
Your backpack's full. {LF}Can't give it to ya like that.
Make sure you look after Mana.
Mornin'.
Good morning, Douglas.
Howdy, kiddo!
Hello, Douglas.

Happy New Year, kid! {LF}Hope you're ready for it!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}Hope you're ready for it!
Come to think of it, this is the {LF}season we met, isn't it?
You like cherry blossoms, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Your dad liked 'em.
Today's the Eating Contest. {LF}You gonna enter, ＠カイル＠＠? {LF}I'm not gonna go easy on ya'!
Today's the Eating Contest. {LF}You gonna enter, ＠アルス＠＠?
Dang it! {LF}Can't believe you beat me, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}I'll remember this next year!
You won, ＠アルス＠＠! That's great!
Ha ha ha! Was the outcome ever in{LF}doubt? I'm numero uno when it comes{LF}ta' eatin'.
Dang it! {LF}I can't believe I lost to Gordon! {LF}I'm never gonna live this down.
You lost, huh? {LF}Remember to try harder next year, kid.
You lost, huh? {LF}Just 'cause you're a kid don't mean {LF}you shouldn't push yourself with {LF}these things.
It's the start of swimming season! {LF}I can't wait to put on my swimming{LF}trunks and show off my muscles!{LF}It really drives the ladies wild.
Every kid should play in the water{LF}in summer. Make sure you get out there{LF}and have fun!
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}You gonna take part, kid?
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}You gonna take part, ＠アルス＠＠?
Not bad, not bad at all! {LF}You're tougher than you look!
Nice goin' there, ＠アルス＠＠!
You lost, huh? {LF}Learn from it. Let it make you stronger.
You lost, huh? Losin's a bad {LF}habit to get into when you're a kid. {LF}You gotta nip it in the bud{LF}or else it'll stick with you for good.
Today's the Dance Festival... 
Just so you know, if you wanna ask {LF}Mana to dance, you gotta get through {LF}me first!
Umm...okay.
Dance Festival... {LF}You kids are too young for that.
Today's the Fishing Contest. {LF}I don't like fishin'. They don't make{LF}any poles sturdy enough for my{LF}monster-size mitts.
Today's the Big Cook-Off. {LF}Start off eatin' like a hog when you're {LF}a kid and you'll regret it when you're {LF}older.
So you won, did you? {LF}I never knew fishin' was your thing.
You won, eh? {LF}Not bad for a kid.
You lost, huh? Hey, if you can't get{LF}the hang of the fishing pole, maybe{LF}you should try wrestling 'em with{LF}your bare hands.
Heck, you don't need to know how to {LF}cook! Just eat stuff raw!
Today's the Adventure Contest. {LF}Every man's gotta go out on {LF}adventures! I better see you in there!
Today's the Adventure Contest. {LF}Even kids can participate, so don't{LF}miss it!
Nice goin', kid! I'm impressed!
You lost, huh? Well, just get on back {LF}and try again next year.
Not bad, ＠アルス＠＠. Not bad.
You lost, huh? Well, just get on back {LF}and try again next year.
Time for the Harvest Festival. {LF}Get any good vegetables from my {LF}field?
Time for the Harvest Festival. {LF}Even you kids can help out with this {LF}one. We'll be countin' on ya.
Today's the Monster Contest. {LF}Nothin' wrong with a little of that {LF}every now and then.
Today's the Monster Contest. {LF}Nothin' wrong with a little of that {LF}every now and then.
You get along well with those things, {LF}don't you?
Your monster won, huh? {LF}Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
You need to get into it more next time. {LF}Go all out.
Try not to think about it. {LF}Just make sure you get back up when {LF}you fall.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}Not like I should have to mention this, {LF}but don't expect to be walkin' 'round {LF}alone with my Mana late at night.
The only time kids can see shootin' {LF}stars is when they should be in their {LF}beds.
Today's the Mining Contest, {LF}when men square off with each other {LF}armed with nothin' but a hammer.
So it's the Mining Contest, huh? {LF}You got yourself a hammer?
Not bad, not bad. {LF}Next time I'll have to personally show {LF}you how it's done!
You lost, huh? {LF}Well, better luck next time!
You won, did ya? {LF}Not bad, ＠アルス＠＠!
First thing you gotta do is build up {LF}your arms. That's key.
Well, today's the end of another year. {LF}We gotta toughen ya up even more {LF}next year, kid!
Well, today's the end of another year. {LF}You be sure to keep up that studyin', {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Had a look at the bulletin board, {LF}did ya?
I want you to go bring me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ from{LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}Tanya's got her eye on it.
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G in return.
Go find a ＠アイテム９＠ from{LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}for me.
You can reach{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}from the north of town.
Any luck yet? {LF}If you find a ＠アイテム９＠, {LF}come back and see me.
To select an item to hand over, {LF}press the L Button and the A Button {LF}together. Every man's gotta know {LF}that one!
I think you may have what it takes {LF}after all, kid!
You read the bulletin board, did you? {LF}I...I got into a bit of a fight with Mana.
Is that right?
I wrote her a letter to apologize. {LF}Think you could give it to her for me?
(Why don't you just give it to her? {LF}Douglas is such a sap when it comes {LF}to Mana.)
Will you do it for me?
Sure, no problem.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Oh, looks like your backpack's full. {LF}I can't give it to you in that case.
Go give Mana the ＠アイテム９＠ for me. {LF}Maybe you could see how she's doing {LF}too.
Okay.
I gave it to her.
How'd it go? {LF}She...She wasn't mad or anything, {LF}was she?
No, not at...
She...She didn't say she was gonna {LF}go elope, did she?
No, she didn't say anything about {LF}eloping or...
Oooohh, I knew it! I knew it! {LF}You convinced her to run away with {LF}you, didn't you!
Douglas, please! Calm down!
You'll never get my Mana! {LF}Not as long as I'm still breathin'!
I...I don't know what I'd do {LF}if I ever lost her... 
She said she isn't mad anymore.
R-Really? Really? {LF}You're...You're not messin' with me {LF}or anythin', are ya?
No, it's the truth.
Boy, that's great! {LF}Thanks, kid! I've felt so terrible{LF}since we had that fight.
(And I thought he was gonna {LF}kill me right then... Whew.)
Here, I want you to have these for {LF}helpin' me out. 100 logs. {LF}Make sure you put 'em to good use.
You got 100 logs!
I owe ya one, kid. {LF}I'm no good with these delicate sorts {LF}of situations. Thanks. Really.
I shoulda known you'd come, ＠カイル＠＠.
What's up? It sounded serious.
Well, s'about Mana. {LF}It seems she's takin' a likin' to {LF}someone.
O-Oh, is that so?
Who d'ya think it is?
Ray?
Jake?
Barrett?
Max?
Ray? Hmm... You know, I don't think so.
Jake? I don't think he's her type.
Barrett? Well, a lot of girls do go for {LF}the bad boy type, but not Mana.
Max? Mana's not the kinda girl who {LF}goes after money.
S-So, in that case... {LF}that just leaves me, I guess...{LF}Heh heh. 
Oh, I knew it! I knew it had to be you!
I-I'm sorry!
(Wait, why do I have to apologize?)
You'll never get my Mana! {LF}Not as long as I'm still breathin'! {LF}Never!
Y-Yes, sir!
Well, I feel a lot better now. {LF}'Guess talkin' really is the best {LF}way to vent about something.
Th-That's what they say, heh heh... 
(Douglas is a nice guy. {LF}He can just get a little out of control {LF}when it comes to Mana.)
Here, I want you to have this. {LF}It's actually pretty handy. {LF}See what you can do with it.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Whoops, looks like your backpack's {LF}full.
Thanks for listenin' to me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I feel a lot better now.
I hope someday Mana'll... {LF}Wait, what am I sayin'! {LF}She's still too young for that!
Read the bulletin board, did you?
Yes.
Meet me at{LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}We'll talk there.
Umm, okay.
See you at{LF}＠マップ９＠, okay?
Mana... 
Hey there, ＠アルス＠＠. Would you give{LF}this here ＠アイテム９＠ to Ray for me?
Sure!
Sure!
I've got a special reward for you if {LF}you do! Thanks much!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Go give that ＠アイテム９＠ to Ray, {LF}okay?
I see you gave it to him! Thanks!
Well, here's what I promised ya.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Give that to Mana when she's at the{LF}school, and she'll fix up one of your{LF}magic books for you!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Oh, looks like your backpack's full. {LF}You'll have to get rid of something {LF}first.
You noticed anything unusual in town, {LF}Douglas? I'm out patrolling right now.
Anythin' unusual? {LF}Haven't seen a thing! {LF}Look at you, out patrollin' and {LF}everything!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}Here to buy out my inventory again?
Heh. Um, not right now. Hey, do you{LF}have any healthy food in stock? 
Ah. Food, huh? Let's see, food, food... 
Well, I have some ＠アイテム８＠ and {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Oh, well, maybe I'll take the ＠アイテム９＠.
What? You're a man, boy! {LF}Whaddaya want a ＠アイテム９＠ for?
A man should go with ＠アイテム８＠!{LF}They're deep-fried and delicious!
＠アイテム９＠'ll never make ya {LF}big 'n strong! Ga ha ha!
Oh, no, it isn't for me.
I'm tellin' you, you want the {LF}＠アイテム８＠!
I'll take the ＠アイテム８＠
I'll take the ＠アイテム９＠
Atta' boy! Eat these every day, {LF}and you'll be big 'n strong in no time! {LF}Ga ha ha!
You received a ＠アイテム８＠.
(Boy, Douglas really knows how to{LF}push a sale...)
I want the ＠アイテム９＠!
Ga ha ha ha! That stuff's for sissies! {LF}You'll never grow up to be big 'n {LF}strong like that!
Be a man, boy!
(It's not for me, for goodness sake...)
Here, here's your little ＠アイテム９＠, {LF}Miss ＠カイル＠＠.
You received a ＠アイテム９＠.
Thank you.
Oh, looks like your backpack's full. {LF}You'll have to dump something out first.
What's it gonna be today?{LF}Don't be shy, now! Ga ha ha ha!
How much can I interest ya in today, {LF}eh?
Nice try, Douglas, {LF}but that's not why I'm here.
Ga ha ha ha! {LF}I shoulda guessed you'd say that!
So why are you here?
Actually, there's something I wanted {LF}to ask you.
Julia told me you got in the bath {LF}before it was ready and burned {LF}yourself. Why'd you do that?
Oh, that. Well, I'd been workin' and {LF}gotten all sweaty, and I just needed {LF}to cool off pronto.
There was already water in the tub, {LF}so I just jumped in.
It wasn't her fault that the water{LF}was too danged hot.
I got in before I should have.
Sure, I got burned a little, {LF}but I got no one to blame but myself.
Can’t argue there...  {LF}Julia seems concerned about it. {LF}Are you okay now?
Burns are part of bein' a man! {LF}You call that pain? I'll be fine! {LF}Ga ha ha ha!
Ha ha, I should've known you'd say {LF}that, Douglas. Nothing gets to you.
A few burns every now 'n then'll {LF}toughen ya up! They're good for ya!
I...I beg to differ... 
Well, I guess I'll be going now, {LF}Douglas. Thanks for everything.
You better be ready to buy {LF}somethin' next time!
Looks like spring's finally made her {LF}way 'round.
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival. {LF}Whenever the cherry blossoms {LF}come out, it's time to drink. {LF}Ha ha ha!
Ya feel that earthquake? {LF}That got me out of bed fast!
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest.
No one beats me when it's come to {LF}drinkin', 'less it's that girly juice {LF}Herman drinks.
Swimming season starts tomorrow. You're {LF}not thinkin' of catchin' a glimpse {LF}of Mana in her swimsuit, are ya?
Tomorrow's the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. Men need to know how to {LF}handle monsters.
Good gracious, another earthquake! {LF}What in the world's goin' on?
Hot, hot, hot! So dang hot! {LF}Hot summers are great for toughenin' {LF}ya up, though.
I hear tomorrow's the Dance Festival. {LF}Don't even think about dancing with{LF}Mana, kid.
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest. {LF}Waste a' time.
Tomorrow's the Adventure Contest. {LF}"Adventure..." Now there's a word that {LF}gets my heart racin'!
Another earthquake, huh? {LF}Hope this ain't the start of somethin' {LF}serious.
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival. {LF}We all need to give thanks to {LF}Mother Earth for everythin' she does.
Fall really has settled in now. {LF}Don't think you can slack off on {LF}the physical activity, though!
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest. {LF}Get in there and show 'em what you're {LF}made of, kid!
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}You're not thinkin' of goin' with Mana, {LF}are ya?
Now that winter's here, you can go {LF}outside naked and really toughen {LF}yourself up in that cold!
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest. {LF}I love just grabbin' that hammer {LF}and getting' out there and smashin' {LF}away at those rocks!
Well, another earthquake. {LF}I'm startin' to get a little worried. {LF}What do ya think's goin' on?
That's another year under the ol' belt. {LF}Good luck next year, kid! Ga ha ha!
It's a nice time of year now, {LF}don't ya think, ＠アルス＠＠?
Kids should be outside in the summer.
Everythin' tastes so great in Fall! {LF}You kids gotta eat to make sure you {LF}grow up big 'n strong!
We were always getting' into snowball {LF}fights when I was a kid.
You like things in Alvarna, kid?
You like this place, kid?
I love it. Mana does, too.
Ya gotta watch out when you're out {LF}about town at night. Well, not out here.{LF}Got nothin' to worry about in a place {LF}like this. Ga ha ha!
Sometimes Mana's food don't taste {LF}that great, to be honest with ya.
I always eat every last bite, though.
Yesterday's lunch was really tasty, {LF}it was.
Yesterday's dinner was pretty good. {LF}I always eat everythin' Mana puts out, {LF}though.
I like ＠アイテム０＠, kid. {LF}It's a kind of fish.{LF}Let me know if you ever catch any!
I like ＠アイテム０＠, kid. {LF}Don't forget that, now.
I like ＠アイテム０＠, kid. {LF}Hint hint.
You made any friends yet, kid?
I often spend time drinkin' at Natalie's {LF}place. Sometimes Gordon and Tanya {LF}come, too.
Can't believe Gordon drinks despite {LF}bein' a priest. What a riot! Ga ha ha!
You made any friends yet, kid?
I often spend time drinkin' at Natalie's {LF}place. Sometimes Gordon and Tanya {LF}come too.
I know Natalie's isn't a bar. {LF}It's a clinic. Why can't someone {LF}open a bar 'round here?
You made any friends yet, kid?
I often spend time drinkin' at Natalie's {LF}place. Sometimes Gordon and Tanya {LF}come too.
Tanya loves swords. {LF}She likes to twirl them around while{LF}she drinks.
You could say she's my other {LF}special little lady. Ga ha ha!
Norad's where mankind first appeared. {LF}Anyone ever tell you that before, kid?
Wanna know a little trivia? {LF}Norad's the birthplace of mankind.
Ya learn somethin' every day, {LF}huh, kid?
You know this town's located at the {LF}edge of Norad?
You're awful cheerful for this time of {LF}the day. Somethin' happen?
Long as I'm with Mana, I'm always {LF}cheerful. Ga ha ha!
What's got you so excited, kid? {LF}Somethin' happen?
Mana always makes life excitin' for {LF}me. Ga ha ha!
You shouldn't go out wanderin' at {LF}night, kid.
You're not thinkin' of askin' Mana {LF}out this late, are ya?
N-No, I'd never do something like that.
Good.
I'll tell ya somethin' good, kid. {LF}＠アイテム０＠'s{LF}one of my favorites.
I'll tell ya somethin' good, kid. {LF}＠アイテム０＠'s{LF}one of my favorites.
I'll tell ya somethin' good, kid. {LF}＠アイテム０＠'s{LF}one of my favorites.
Mana's been wantin' all kinds of {LF}clothes lately.
I think she looks best with what she's {LF}got on.
Mana's been readin' nothin' but fashion {LF}magazines these days.
What's so interestin' 'bout that stuff? {LF}Any idea, kid?
N-No, not really... 
Must be her age, but fashion's all Mana {LF}thinks about anymore.
You the same way, kid?
N-No, I don't have much interest in {LF}that kind of thing.
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout a {LF}ghost appearin' in front of the {LF}clinic in the middle of the night.
It's the mornin' right now! Ga ha ha!
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout a {LF}ghost appearin' in front of the clinic {LF}in the middle of the night.
Those stories are usually a load of {LF}baloney.
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout a {LF}ghost appearin' in front of the {LF}clinic in the middle of the night.
I've never seen anythin' like that, {LF}but then again I'm always drinkin' there.
I hate ＠アイテム０＠, kid. {LF}Try to remember that.
There's not many things I don't like, {LF}but ＠アイテム０＠S are one of them. {LF}Try to remember that, kid.
Looks like the sun's gone down. {LF}By the way, I hate ＠アイテム０＠, kid. {LF}Just so you know.
What a nice mornin'. {LF}Hey, I ever tell ya my birthday's {LF}the 2nd of Spring, kid?
Man, I'm hungry. {LF}Hey, I ever tell ya my birthday's {LF}the 2nd of Spring, kid?
Well, it's just 'bout time for bed for{LF}me. Hey, I ever tell ya my birthday's {LF}the 2nd of Spring, kid?
You've really gotten settled in here, {LF}haven't you, ＠カイル＠＠?
You've really gotten settled in here, {LF}haven't you, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Keep up the good work, kid.
You've really gotten settled in here, {LF}haven't you, ＠カイル＠＠?
You're tougher than I thought, kid. {LF}You been workin' real hard out there. {LF}Ga ha ha!
Nice to see you out here in the day, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
How's the work goin'? It's hard when {LF}the sun gets real hot, huh?
You enjoy farm work?
It's fun.
Not really.
Glad to see you're enjoyin' it. {LF}I was right to lend you the field.
Oh, you don't enjoy it? {LF}Well, you only get what you put into it.
Who do you think's got the bigger {LF}muscles, me or Gordon?
Uh, gee, I couldn't tell you...
One thing Gordon'll never be is {LF}stronger than me. My pride's ridin' {LF}on it! You know what I mean, {LF}right, kid?
Uhh, yeah.
I do 1,000 pushups after every meal.{LF}That's the secret to preservin' {LF}your strength.
Say, you gotten any of your memory {LF}back, ＠カイル＠＠?
Say, you gotten any of your memory {LF}back, ＠カイル＠＠? I wonder why you {LF}lost it to begin with, huh?
Say, you gotten any of your memory {LF}back, ＠カイル＠＠? I wonder if pushups {LF}could help out with that kinda thing.
What do you wanna do when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't really decided yet.
I see. Make sure you get it right. {LF}Just don't spend too long. Youth {LF}disappears before you know it.
What do you wanna do when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't really decided yet.
I see. Mana was sayin' she wants to {LF}become a teacher.
What do you wanna do when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't really decided yet.
I see. Well, somethin' to think about {LF}when you're eatin'.
I get the feelin' I've been getting {LF}weaker lately. What's your opinion?
I don't see a difference.
Now that you mention it...
I see. Must be my mind playin' tricks {LF}on me.
You think so too, huh? Maybe I gotta {LF}up the workout to 2,000 pushups, then.
I get the feelin' I've been getting' {LF}weaker lately. What's your opinion?
I don't see a difference.
Are you sure you've been eating right?
I see. Must be my mind playin' tricks {LF}on me.
I had lunch today. {LF}It was pretty good too, for a change.
For a change?
Uhh...we don't need to let Mana {LF}know I said that, okay?
I get the feelin' I've been getting' {LF}weaker lately. What's your opinion?
I don't see a difference.
Maybe you're just tired.
I see. Must be my mind playin' tricks {LF}on me.
Please! I'm not a bit tired!
I got into an argument with Gordon.
Really?
I accidentally broke one of the tables {LF}in the church.
Well, you should probably apologize {LF}for something like that.
Yeah.
I got into an argument with Natalie.
Really?
She says I'm always freeloading drinks{LF}offa her! 
Well, you do drink over there a lot.{LF}Do you ever bring your own drinks?
Huh. I guess she might have a point.
I got into an argument with Tanya.
Really?
It was in her shop, and we got into a{LF}sword fight. We both got a couple of{LF}cuts, but neither one of us was really{LF}out for blood.
Still, it was a good way to blow{LF}off some steam!
You ever thought about marriage, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
I see.
What?! Not..Not..Not with my Mana?! 
Oh, no, no... Ha ha ha.
You'll have to go through me if ya {LF}want my Mana! And I ain't movin'!
She ain't marryin' nobody!
Umm, okay.
But I wonder if that's what's really{LF}best for Mana... Hmm... 
You ever thought about marriage, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
Good. You're too young anyway.
What?! You're not thinkin' about Mana, {LF}are ya?
Oh, no, no... Ha ha ha.
Mana gets married over my dead body!
Then I'm sure she's never getting {LF}married.
You ever thought about marriage, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
Good. You're too young anyway.
What?! You know I don't want Mana {LF}marryin' nobody, and you got your {LF}eye on her?
Oh, no, no...ha ha ha.
Fine. Beat an Elder Dragon with {LF}your bare hands, then we'll talk!
Ha ha ha... Ha... 
All I want's to make sure my Mana's {LF}happy.
That's why I gotta make sure {LF}she gets the best.
I know one day she's gonna head out {LF}into the world.
I gotta make sure her man's ready. {LF}Only the best for Mana! Ga ha ha!
Mana's too young to be thinkin' 'bout {LF}marriage yet.
You're saying she's not the right age?
Not the right age in my book, anyway!
You know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No.
Yes.
You know the monsters around here? {LF}That's where they come from.
Whaddaya reckon's in this so-called {LF}forest?
Why the heck isn't there a bar in this {LF}town? Any idea?
I've no idea.
Not enough space?
Listen to me, what am I askin' you for?
Maybe there just isn't any room for {LF}new businesses?
Yeah, maybe you're right. There isn't{LF}a lot of room for this town to{LF}expand.
You think it's strange that Gordon's {LF}a priest?
A little, yeah.
Must be his calling.
Yeah, he's more the type to punch ya {LF}in the face than give ya a sermon.
Yeah? {LF}Some say he's beaten people up for {LF}not confessin' before.
You got any problems with things {LF}'round here at all?
No, not really.
Byron's doin' a great job. I don't think {LF}things are goin' so great between him {LF}and his son, though.
I know what it's like takin' care of a {LF}kid that age.
What do you think we could do to {LF}improve the town, ＠カイル＠＠?
Hmm...that's a difficult question.
It feels like there's somethin' missin' {LF}here. Can't put my finger on it.
You friends with Barrett, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes.
Not really.
I see. Maybe you could ask him what {LF}he's got against his old man.
Byron's worried about it.
I see. Well, can't really ask him if you {LF}don't know him.
Farming is about livin' together with {LF}the land. It's a blessin', really.
Yeah. All thanks to Mother Earth.
I love breathin' the fresh mornin' air. {LF}Food's good too...usually. Ga ha ha!
The land and the sun give us {LF}everythin'. Rain or shine, {LF}that's nature lookin' down on us.
Yeah.
Gets real cold soon as the sun goes {LF}down, don't it?
Yeah.
I hope we get some good weather {LF}tomorrow.
Me too.
You know about the Elder Dragons?
They're ancient and powerful dragons. {LF}Supposedly this country's got four of {LF}'em.
You know about the Elder Dragons?
I'd like to take one of those things on {LF}someday. Ga ha ha!
You know about the Elder Dragons?
No.
Yes.
One appeared in Kardia many years ago. {LF}Wiped out the Sechs forces with just {LF}one breath. So they say.
Those things are almost like a force{LF}of nature. I'd like to see one with{LF}my own eyes one day...
Listen, ＠カイル＠＠...
Yes?
You really are doin' a great job, kid. {LF}You're somethin' else.
Thank you.
Listen, ＠カイル＠＠...
Yes?
The way you live together with the land {LF}is really somethin' else.
Thanks. I guess farming must be in{LF}my blood.
Listen, ＠カイル＠＠...
Yes?
I get the feelin'...you may just be {LF}what Mana needs.
Thank you.
I hope you'll keep your respect for {LF}nature, ＠カイル＠＠.
You look lively today!
Make sure you're studyin'. {LF}Your dad built that school, you know.
You made any friends at school?
Your energy rubs off on me, kid.
Your father was an incredible man. {LF}He was strong and carin'. {LF}I hope you'll follow in his footsteps.
I came to talk.
I came to buy.
Never mind.
Welcome! {LF}Don't feel shy 'bout spendin' that {LF}allowance, kid!
Spring Special
Summer Special
Fall Special
Winter Special
Come back again!
What do you wanna be when you {LF}grow up, ＠アルス＠＠?
What about a businessman like me? {LF}I think that's what you should be.
Above all, have fun when you're a kid.
Your father was an incredible man. {LF}No mistake 'bout that.
Not often I see you here, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You need to talk to me?
I don't feel like goin' out much when {LF}every day's this hot.
Sometimes even I just wanna relax {LF}at home.
I can't believe how cold it is. {LF}I need a fireplace in here.
You helpin' your mom out every day, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Make sure you look after your {LF}vegetables in the summer. {LF}Knowin' the strength of the land is the {LF}most important thing in farmin'.
Fall's when all that work pays off. {LF}Put your nose to the grindstone.
Can't do any farmin' in winter. {LF}Kids can make themselves some {LF}snowmen, but that's 'bout it.
I like takin' walks 'round the park {LF}every once in a while.
In summer I just wanna jump right in {LF}that fountain! Ga ha ha!
I always get real lonely this time of {LF}year.
We had snowball fights whenever it{LF}snowed when I was a kid.
Gordon might not set the best {LF}example, but listenin' to sermons is {LF}not a bad habit to get into as a kid.
Hot today, huh, ＠アルス＠＠?
I liked playin' hide-and-seek in the {LF}church when I was a kid.
The snow don't stop the sermons, {LF}does it? Hats off to him.
You've been playin' outside of town {LF}lately, haven't ya, ＠アルス＠＠?
I've noticed you've been actin' older {LF}than your age lately, ＠アルス＠＠.
You haven't been out fightin' with any {LF}monsters, have you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You always seem to have cuts {LF}these days, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You haven't been doin' anythin' you {LF}shouldn't, have you?
You seem more 'n more like an adult {LF}these days, ＠アルス＠＠.
I get the feelin' you've done {LF}somethin' or other big.
Your dad's back, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}That's great!
I feel great as ever today.
I feel great as ever today.
＠カイル＠＠? What's the letter for?
Your dad asked me to give it to you.
Dad? Lemme read it.
Sure.
"Dear Mana,{LF}Yesterday was just a big {LF}misunderstandin'. Umm...you see..."
What's it say?
Ha ha, well, Dad and I had an {LF}argument. I guess it got to him.
I'd completely forgotten about it.
You've got a great father.
Yeah. I think so too. {LF}Tell him I'm not mad or anything, {LF}will you?
Okay.
Thanks! I love these.
You found the ＠アイテム９＠! {LF}Thanks! I'm so happy!
Maybe Alicia's reading was right {LF}after all...
Reading?
Uh, n-nothing, nothing! Ha ha. {LF}Thanks. Here's ＠数字９＠G {LF}in return.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'll also give you 100 logs, too. {LF}I'm sure you can use them for something.
You got 100 logs!
Thanks. I hope I can count on you {LF}again if I need help.
Is this for me? Thanks.
You found the ＠アイテム９＠! {LF}Wow! Where was it?
Under the wooden box.
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.
Thanks! I was looking everywhere {LF}for it. Here's ＠数字９＠G in return.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks. If anything else comes up, {LF}I'll let you know!
Oh, is this for me?
Oh! You caught a ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks! I've had such a craving{LF}for this! {LF}Here's ＠数字９＠G in return.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks. It must be nice to be able to {LF}fish anywhere. I can only fish where{LF}there aren't monsters.
Looks like they're no problem for you,{LF}though! Ha ha!
Oh, is this for me?
Sorry, but I can't accept this. {LF}I still don't know what to do.
If you have this, then that means...{LF}you defeated my father?
Ha ha. No, things didn't quite work{LF}out that way. But he did give me his{LF}permission to marry you.
That's wonderful! I'm so happy,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
I'll make sure you stay that way.
But...you're already married, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Too bad.
Thank you! I love these!
Ahh, I can't stand these!{LF}I can't even look at them!
Thank you! I love these!
Ahh, I can't stand these!{LF}I can't even look at them!
Should I drink this? Mmm, this is{LF}good!
Hey, that made me feel pretty good. {LF}Thanks.
Should I drink this? Mmm, this is {LF}good! Thanks.
Should I drink this? Mmm, this is {LF}good!
I...I feel all funny. {LF}What a weird feeling.
I love these, but I would've {LF}preferred it on my birthday.
Thanks! Today's my birthday. {LF}I can't believe you got me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠! Wow.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, {LF}but I shouldn't accept so much {LF}on my birthday.
I love this, but I would've {LF}preferred it on my birthday.
Thanks! Today's my birthday.  {LF}I can't believe you got me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠! Wow.
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, {LF}but I shouldn't accept so much {LF}on my birthday.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Why are you giving this to me?
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Why are you giving this to me?
Remember to buy something!{LF}Right now, I recommend buying{LF}something from our Spring Special!
The heat's always rough in summer. {LF}Can we interest you in a parasol? {LF}Or two, or three... {LF}
Fall always revs up everyone's {LF}appetites. How about some cooking {LF}products?
It's hard to know what to sell in winter.
This is my room. Not bad, huh?
It gets really hot in here in summer. {LF}Sometimes I sleep out in the hall.
I like looking at the Fall leaves {LF}outside my window.
It gets hot in here in summer, {LF}but cold in the winter. {LF}Hard to know what to do, really!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. What's up?
Did you come to see me?
Are we bothering you? Ha ha.
N-No, not at all.
Alicia, Ceci...don't tease him. Come on.
Really hot today, huh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
Why do you want go to Mana's {LF}room in this heat?
Things might end up even hotter, ha ha.
C-Ceci! What are you talking about!
Looks like Fall's arrived, huh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
Fall's the perfect time {LF}for fortune-telling.
I've never heard anyone say that {LF}before.
It's become cold now, huh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
But things always seem hot between {LF}you two no matter the weather.
I think so too. Must be nice.
Would you guys cut it out?!
Oh, lighten up.
So who warms your heart this time of {LF}year, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, gee, I...
I wish there was someone who made {LF}me feel that way.
Wait, is there someone like that, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, no, ha ha ha.
I like eating lunch in the park. {LF}You wanna eat together sometime?
Even the park's hot in the summer.
We should all drink some cider{LF}together in the park some time. {LF}It's Fall, after all!
I like talking outside sometimes, {LF}even if it is cold. Know what I mean?
It's fun getting together in the park {LF}with friends and talking. You know, {LF}girl talk, he he.
You talk to girls a lot, ＠カイル＠＠?
N-No, not really.
Really?
Really.
But I wouldn't mind you listening{LF}in on our talks, hee hee.
It's really hot, huh, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah, sure is.
Does the heat get to you?
No, I'm fine.
Mana's what gets to you, huh? Ha ha.
Alicia! What's that supposed to mean?
Just watch out for her dad.
Can't argue with that.
Man, I'm so hungry. Fall always does{LF}that to me.
I hear you. But if I eat too much,{LF}I'll really start to pack on the{LF}pounds.
What's a girl to do?
I never gain weight no matter how {LF}much I eat.
Because you're an elf, huh? Lucky.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. Skipping work today?
No, I'm still working. As much as {LF}winter allows it, ha ha.
Yeah, you can't do anything when it {LF}snows, huh?
Right.
Ceci can work all year round.
So can you, Alicia.
Technically, yeah, but since I work {LF}outside, it's harder in winter.
So why don't you just do it inside?
My mom won't let me tell fortunes in{LF}the clinic. She says she doesn't want{LF}me brining that nonsense into a place{LF}of medicine.
I love it here in spring. {LF}The cherry blossoms are so pretty.
It's nice in summer too. {LF}The trees don't look as nice, {LF}of course.
It's kinda sad here in Fall. {LF}I still like it, though.
Everything turns white here in winter. {LF}I hope we get an early spring.
I feel like taking a bath{LF}twice a day.
That's what happens in summer, yeah. {LF}The best thing after a bath is a nice {LF}glass of milk.
Baths feel nice in autumn too. {LF}Don't you agree, ＠カイル＠＠?
You can't live without baths in winter! {LF}They warm you up right to your core.
Father Gordon doesn't look like very...{LF}Father-ly, does he?
Yeah, he looks more like a soldier.
Father Gordon's clothes must get hot {LF}in summer. Maybe they don't bother {LF}him?
It's gotten really cold lately. {LF}Winter'll be here soon.
The church always feels so tense {LF}in the winter.
How's the farm work going? {LF}Great time of year to be out there!
It must get really hot in the fields {LF}in summer, huh?
Time for the autumn harvest! {LF}How's everything looking?
Not a whole lot you can do in {LF}winter, huh?
This will be your farm,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Wow, this place is huge!
It actually hasn't been used{LF}in a while, so it'll need a little{LF}work... Hee-hee...
I think I can handle it.{LF}Don't worry.
Sounds good. Here. Take this{LF}hoe and watering can.
Go ahead and try them out!
Uh, you mean like,{LF}right now?
Mana just told you to try 'em out! {LF}What are you waiting for? Be a man!
Y-Yes, sir!
Wow, you look like a natural!
R-Really?
Yep! Now try the watering can.
Wow! You already water so well!
Yeah! If I didn't know any better,{LF}I'd say you were born to do this!{LF}There's a natural farmer somewhere{LF}in you, kid!
Well, I...I don't know about{LF}that... 
We can give you both together for {LF}100G. It's a special sale price! {LF}Take it or leave it!
What?! 100 for both?! {LF}That's cheap! Too cheap,{LF}kiddo!
Buy.
Don't buy.
I only have 150G right now...
Thank you! Well, good luck,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Oh, we also sell seeds at our{LF}house, so be sure to stop by{LF}sometime!
Do us proud, kid! Ya don't work,{LF}ya don't eat! Ga ha ha ha!
(I think I may have been tricked{LF}into working here...)
Okay! Now, you need to give{LF}your farm a name! What would{LF}you like to call it?
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}Nice.
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}Cool.
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}Kind of a sharp ring to it.
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}That's a fun name.
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}Interesting choice.
＠牧場＠ Farm, huh? {LF}Well, to each his own, I suppose. {LF}Ha ha ha!
Thanks!
All right, looks like you're all set,{LF}then! Well, you should get to{LF}work and start making money!
Um...y-yeah, I guess you're{LF}right...
See you later, ＠カイル＠＠!
See you later, Mana.
Remember to come by our{LF}shop if you have any questions!{LF}Oh, or if you want to buy{LF}something!
O-Okay! Will do!
Thanks! And good luck!
Oh, you'll need to empty your {LF}backpack a little before we talk. {LF}Have at least two empty slots.
Oh, your backpack's full.
How you gonna farm without{LF}a hoe and a watering can?!{LF}Think about it, kid!
Y-Yes, sir!
But you'll still have 50G left{LF}over! You'll be fine!
A man spends what he earns! {LF}Buys what he needs!
How do you grow crops?
Let's talk!
Never mind...
How do you use tools?
How do you plant seeds?
How do you ship crops?
Never mind...
Using tools is fundamental to {LF}working on a farm.
You can equip the hoe or the{LF}watering can by first pushing the{LF}L Button and B Button at the same{LF}time, and then pushing the B Button.
After you've done that, go to your{LF}field, and press the B Button{LF}to use it!
Oh, and here's a tip! Hold down{LF}the B Button, and then release it{LF}to use the item on a wider area!
To plant seeds, you first have to {LF}plow your field. Seeds won't grow{LF}in a field that isn't plowed.
First, press the L Button and{LF}B Button at the same time. Then,{LF}select the seeds you want to{LF}plant from the list that appears.
Then, go to the field where you{LF}want to plant the seeds, and press{LF}the B Button.
Remember to water your seeds,{LF}or else they won't grow!
Press the L Button and B Button{LF}at the same time, then switch to{LF}the watering can. Then, press the{LF}B Button to water your seeds!
When your water runs out, {LF}you'll need to fill it back up.
This is the watering hole. {LF}Stand in front of it, and press{LF}the B Button to fill up your can.
You can hold down and then release{LF}the B Button when you water. That{LF}way, you can water a wider area!{LF}Neat, huh?
You have to water your crops once a {LF}day. If you don't, they won't grow.
Since you bought the hoe and {LF}watering can, I'll give you these{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
Feeling generous, eh, Mana?{LF}Lucky you, kid! Just make sure you{LF}get those ＠アイテム９＠ to grow!
Y-Yes, sir!
Thank you.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Oh, your backpack's full. {LF}I can't give it to you like this.
Once your crops are ready, {LF}it's time to ship them out.
This is the shipping box. {LF}You can put anything you want to sell {LF}in it, not just crops.
I'll come to collect what you have{LF}in the shipping box at 3 o'clock,{LF}okay?
To harvest crops, stand in front of {LF}one that's ready, and press the {LF}A Button to pick it up.
Then, press the Y Button to put it {LF}in your backpack.
Finally, stand in front of the shipping{LF}box and press the L Button and{LF}A Button at the same time. Then use{LF}the A Button to select what you want!
The entire field is yours to use, {LF}okay? Have fun, ＠カイル＠＠!
Just be careful you don't overwork{LF}yourself.
In the upper-left corner of the {LF}Touch Screen are your HP and RP {LF}bars. See them? You may have to {LF}wait until we're done talking, actually.
Using the hoe or watering can will {LF}deplete your RP. RP are Rune Points, {LF}or the energy of Mother Earth {LF}that's inside you.
When your RP runs out, your HP {LF}will start to go down. HP are {LF}Hit Points, or your physical health.
If your HP reaches zero, {LF}you'll collapse.
If you collapse in town, {LF}you'll end up in the clinic.
If you stay up working till 5 in the {LF}morning, you can get fatigued or sick.{LF}You can't stay up all night like that!
If you don't get the proper amount of{LF}sleep, your HP and RP won't replenish{LF}as fast, and you'll be tired in the{LF}morning. Be sure to get to bed early!
If you ever have any questions, {LF}just let me know, okay?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hi there!
Hello.
Good evening.

Oh, good morning.

Thanks for asking me to dance, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. It made me happy.
Sorry I turned you down earlier. {LF}Maybe you could ask me next year?

Today is the Big Cook-Off.{LF}Do you like to cook, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Or perhaps you prefer to{LF}just to eat the results?

The Adventure Contest is today.{LF}Just why do boys love these kinds{LF}of events so much, anyway?

Sorry for turning you down.

She asked for it ASAP, but{LF}I have my hands full here.{LF}I'll pay you ＠数字９＠G.{LF}Thanks for your help!
You received an ＠アイテム９＠.
That's a very rare flower, actually,{LF}so don't give it to someone else,{LF}or throw it away!
If you happen to lose it by mistake,{LF}go back to the bulletin board{LF}and select "Cancel Request."
Oh, your backpack is full.{LF}I can't give it to you{LF}if you don't have room to carry it.
Remember: Deliver the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Rosalind!{LF}I'm counting on you!

Thank you for making the delivery!{LF}You really helped me out.{LF}Here's the payment I promised you.

You're so kind, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Like...an older brother.
Y-You really think so?
I'm sure I'll need your help again{LF}in the future, ＠カイル＠＠.
Ah, you saw my posting{LF}on the bulletin board? Great!|
The thing is,{LF}I really love ＠アイテム９＠.
So I'd like you to find one for me, ＠カイル＠＠.
That's no problem, but...why me?
Huh? Oh, well, you see...{LF}Oh, that doesn't really matter, does it?
I just want you to be the one{LF}to get it for me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}So...will you?
Yeah, okay. No problem.
Thank you!{LF}You can find ＠アイテム９＠{LF}growing in{LF}＠マップ９＠.
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G{LF}when you're done.{LF}Hurry back!|
Find me a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I've heard they grow in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
But as long as it's a ＠アイテム９＠,{LF}I don't care where it's from.
Have you found a ＠アイテム９＠ yet?{LF}If you have, please give it to me.
I can always count on you, ＠カイル＠＠!|
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You saw the bulletin board?{LF}Thanks for coming.
Did you lose something?
I lost my ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I was really looking forward to{LF}selling it in my shop. I know it would{LF}have gotten a great price!
I'm pretty sure that I lost it{LF}somewhere in my shop.{LF}I'd be so grateful if you found it.
No problem.
Thanks!|{LF}You're so kind, ＠カイル＠＠.
It's too small to see,{LF}so try pressing the A Button{LF}in places you think it might be.
Please find my ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I'm pretty sure I lost it in my shop.
It's too small to see,{LF}so try pressing the A Button{LF}in places you think it might be.
Have you found a ＠アイテム９＠ yet?{LF}If you have, please give it to me.
You're so good at finding things,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, you saw my post{LF}on the bulletin board?{LF}Great!|
I suddenly have this craving{LF}to eat ＠アイテム９＠.
Sure. I get that all the time.
So I'd like you to catch one for me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!|
Hm. A fishing challenge, huh?
I've heard you can find ＠アイテム９＠{LF}at ＠マップ９＠.
Okay.
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G as thanks.{LF}Do your best!|
Please catch a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}Rumor has it you can find them{LF}at ＠マップ９＠.
Hold on...{LF}You do have a fishing pole, right?
If not, you'll need to see Barrett{LF}about his request first.{LF}He loves fishing.
Fish are the best when they're{LF}served as sashimi!|
Have you caught a ＠アイテム９＠ yet?{LF}If you have, please give it to me!
Oh, you saw the bulletin board?
Yeah.{LF}But I don't really understand{LF}what you want me to do.
I need to talk to you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}In our...special place.
Our...special place?
You know where I mean, right?
Of course.
Not really...
Yeah. At least, I think I do.
Really? I'm so happy!{LF}I'll be waiting for you there, then.
Sorry... I don't have a clue.
Oh, come on!{LF}I'm talking about the place{LF}where we first met, of course!
Oh, there.
Come and see me.{LF}I'll be waiting for you there.
I'll be waiting for you there.{LF}Come and see me.
This is the place we first met,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Yeah.
Then my father came running...{LF}I'll never forget the panicked{LF}look on your face!
I really thought he was going to{LF}kill me!
Ha ha ha!{LF}Yeah, my father can be intimidating.
No argument.
So, ＠カイル＠＠, your memory{LF}hasn't come back yet?
Not yet.
Is that hard for you?
Well, it's a little tough not{LF}knowing who I am, but...
But what?
I've made a lot of pleasant memories {LF}here in this town. So...it isn't as {LF}bad as you might think.
I hope I'm a part of some of those {LF}pleasant memories, ＠カイル＠＠.
Of course you are. {LF}I wouldn't even have a place to live{LF}if it wasn't for you!
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}Please don't ever go anywhere! {LF}Don't ever leave!
Don't worry. I don't plan on ever{LF}leaving. I can't imagine wanting to{LF}live anywhere else. Besides, what{LF}would happen to my field if I left?
Oh, so it's only your field that's{LF}keeping you here in town?
No...I mean... Well, let me explain... 
Wh-What's going on here?!
MANA!!! I'm not going to allow you{LF}to marry him! Don't you dare elope!
Oh, dad! Not again!
Look at you two! He was about {LF}to pop the question! I know it!
N-No he wasn't! Please stop{LF}overreacting, Dad!{LF}Hey, who's minding the shop, anyway?
You and I are both here, {LF}so nobody, of course!
That's no good! Think of all the {LF}business we might be missing right{LF}now! You've got to get back there!
Mana!
Go!
Okay, okay. I'm going!{LF}But remember...no eloping!
Your dad doesn't change, does he?
Just how long does he plan on {LF}treating me like his precious {LF}little girl? I'm old enough {LF}to get married if I want to!
Married, huh...?
Ah, well, I mean...I don't mean I'm{LF}going to rush into anything just{LF}because I'm old enough! I need to make{LF}sure I find the right guy first!
Like who? Got anyone in mind?
W-What do you mean? Umm...that's{LF}private...for now.
Anyway, I guess I should head home.{LF}Thanks for coming to talk with me.{LF}I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye, Mana. See you later.
Why, if it isn't ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}How are you doing?
＠カイル＠＠, I take it{LF}you saw the bulletin board.
That's right.
I want to talk to you. Alone, {LF}if possible. Will you come to {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}tomorrow at 6 in the evening?
Tomorrow evening at 6? No problem.
Make sure you don't forget!
Come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}tomorrow at 6 in the evening. {LF}I'll be waiting for you.
Come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}tomorrow at 6 in the evening. {LF}I'll be waiting for you.
You didn't come yesterday, did you? {LF}I waited a long time for you, too! {LF}You could have let me know {LF}that you couldn't make it!
At least cancel the request!
Come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}tomorrow at 6 in the evening. {LF}I'll be waiting.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}You saw my post on {LF}the bulletin board?
Yeah.
Okay, I'd like you to make {LF}a delivery for me. Do you think {LF}you can do it?
No problem. {LF}What am I taking, and to whom?
Okay...it's addressed to someone{LF}living on the farm just outside of town.
The farm just outside of town...? {LF}You mean...me?
Bingo!|{LF}That's right!
You got a present!
Th-Thanks! Wow, can I open it?
Go ahead.
This is...a ＠アイテム９＠?
Yeah!| I knitted it a little bit{LF}each day.
But...it's the middle of spring.
H-Hey, what does it matter if it's{LF}spring?! I just wanted to give you {LF}a ＠アイテム９＠.
But...it's the middle of summer.
It'll still look good on you even in{LF}summer, okay? I've gone to the trouble{LF}of making it for you, so I want to {LF}see it around your neck!
But...it's still only autumn!
Don't worry. {LF}It'll get cold soon enough.
It's winter, too! Perfect timing.
Yeah. I'm glad I got it finished {LF}in time for winter.
Well, thanks. It's a lovely gift.
Tee-hee!| I'm glad you like it.
Hold it! You can't cram it {LF}into that stuffed backpack! {LF}You need to make some room!
I'm so glad I've made you happy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!| 
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you {LF}want to come with me {LF}to ＠マップ９＠?
＠マップ９＠?
Yeah. I want to talk with you there. {LF}You're not busy, are you?
No, I've got time.
Great! I'll meet you there! {LF}Come and find me! Promise!
I'll be in ＠マップ９＠.
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you decided what you {LF}want to be in the future?
Huh? No, not yet.
I think...I'd like to be a teacher. {LF}A school teacher. Do you think{LF}that would suit me?
Hm... A teacher. Wow, Mana, {LF}I'm impressed! That's a pretty{LF}noble calling.
Hey! You make it sound {LF}as if that's a surprise!
Ah ha ha! Sorry, I didn't mean it {LF}like that. But honestly...{LF}I really am very impressed.
A teacher...that's a great idea. {LF}I'm sure you'd make a great {LF}teacher, Mana.
Tee-hee!| I'm happy to hear {LF}you say that!
I'm glad.
So, a quick quiz for you! What is {LF}the most important, have-to-have, {LF}absolutely-cannot-do-without-{LF}thing for a teacher?
Something you need to become a teacher? Could it be...umm...a subject to teach?  A desire to improve yourself and{LF}others? A love of children?
Nope! That's not it! You're{LF}overthinking it, ＠カイル＠＠.
Okay then, teacher, what's the answer?
Simple. A school.
A school... Of course!{LF}There's no school in Alvarna, is there?
Not yet. But look at this place, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Don't you think this {LF}would be the perfect spot for a school?
You're right. There are lovely trees {LF}around here, too. It would be a {LF}great place for children to learn.
Wouldn't it just? That's settled, then!
What is?
What do you think? {LF}You're going to build our school, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
What?! Me?!
That's right. I'm going to teach in {LF}the school that you build, {LF}＠カイル＠＠! How does that sound?
It sounds...pretty good, {LF}actually. Pretty good.
Doesn't it?
A school... I think I can manage that! {LF}But just how much money and {LF}material is this going to take, {LF}I wonder...
Don't worry, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I'm sure you can do it.
Okay. I'll give it my best shot!
Great!| Thanks for coming and {LF}listening to me today, too. I enjoyed {LF}talking about the future with you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Me too.
I'd better get home, anyway. {LF}I'll see you tomorrow!
＠カイル＠＠, let's go on a date!{LF}A date!
Huh? Y-Yeah, okay. {LF}Where do you want to go?
I've been wanting to explore the {LF}furthest reaches of {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}for a while now. Let's do that!
That's too dangerous. {LF}There are lots of monsters there!
Which is why I'm going with you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠! Come on, let's go.
Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you. {LF}It doesn't exactly sound like {LF}a date, either...
Don't worry about that! {LF}I'll meet you in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
I'm going to {LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}See you there!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, you saw {LF}my note on the bulletin board?
Yeah.
I don't really want to talk about {LF}it here, though. Will you come {LF}to ＠マップ９＠?
No problem.
Okay, I'll be waiting for you there. {LF}Make sure to come and find me!
Come to {LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll be waiting for you.
What do you want to talk about, then?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. I can't lie to {LF}myself about my feelings any longer.{LF}I have to be honest, with you {LF}and with myself!
Mana...
＠カイル＠＠...I love you. {LF}I'm in love with you.
I've liked you since the day {LF}we first met...here, on this spot.
It doesn't matter how you feel {LF}about me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}My feelings for you will never change.
Mana...
If you feel the same way about me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠, please give me {LF}an ＠アイテム９＠.
An ＠アイテム９＠?
Receiving one of them along {LF}with a proposal from my love is {LF}my dearest dream.
So where can I find an {LF}＠アイテム９＠?
Ah, well...that's the thing... {LF}My dad's got the only one I know of.
Oh boy, your dad? I really am going {LF}to have to risk my life to get it, then.
Sorry! But my father is one obstacle {LF}you won't be able to avoid, either way.
Yeah, you're right. I guess it's{LF}time to face him, then.
I believe in you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll see you again soon.
Why, if it isn't ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Do you need something?
(Oh, I have to deliver the letter.)
I'm not angry any more. {LF}Don't worry, just spit it out.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. What brings you here?
N-Nothing in particular, {LF}I was just...you know. {LF}What about you?
Me too...I mean...you know.
Yeah...
Okay...
......
......
L-Look...
Yes...?
I'm...I'm sorry, okay.
What are you apologizing for?
It was actually Alicia {LF}who asked me to come here.
I see.{LF}So you don't actually want to be here,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
N-No, that's not what I mean.{LF}Alicia may have asked me to come{LF}here, but that doesn't mean I didn't{LF}want to anyway.
Oh, really?
Yeah. I mean, when I heard you were{LF}here, I definitely wanted to come{LF}here. This is where we first met,{LF}after all.
That's right.
I really like this place now. {LF}It means a lot to me.
I'm glad.
Sorry today was a little weird. But{LF}I wouldn't feel right going on a date{LF}with you just because Alicia asked{LF}me to.
Don't worry about it. I forgive you.
Phew. Thanks!
But in exchange, you have to promise {LF}to take me on a proper date!
A date?! Well, okay. {LF}I think I can manage that.
Well, I should get going.
Okay! See you!
(I think Alicia's prediction{LF}may have hit the mark...this time.)
Mana, anything you need help with? {LF}Any trouble? I'm just patrolling {LF}the town.
Nothing in particular. {LF}Good luck with the patrol!
Spring is wonderful, isn't it? {LF}So warm and fresh! Feels great!
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival, {LF}when we celebrate the blossoming {LF}trees in the park! I love that place.
Which reminds me... {LF}that's the first place we met, {LF}isn't it, ＠カイル＠＠?
That earthquake this morning really{LF}shook me up! I hope we never have{LF}to go through that again!
It's the Eating Contest tomorrow. {LF}Herman was the champion for so{LF}many years that he had to retire to{LF}give other people a shot!
Swimming season starts tomorrow! {LF}I should buy a new bikini this year! {LF}What color do you think I'd look{LF}cutest in?
It's the Monster Taming Contest{LF}tomorrow, isn't it? I've heard that {LF}capturing monsters is pretty hard work.
Say, that earthquake this morning was{LF}pretty scary, wasn't it? We've been {LF}having quite a few like that recently.
It's hot! I feel like I'm going {LF}to melt. I could really do with {LF}an ice cream!
It's the Dance Festival tomorrow.{LF}Girls like it when guys ask them{LF}to dances, you know.
It's the Fishing Contest tomorrow. {LF}If you are going to take part,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, make sure you catch{LF}at least a whale!
Seriously! I've seen some people catch{LF}the hugest fish in that contest!
The Adventure Contest is really {LF}quite exciting, isn't it? Maybe I {LF}should sign up too!
The earthquake this morning really {LF}scared me. It made a real mess {LF}of the shop, too.
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival. {LF}We have to give thanks for another {LF}year of blessings from the earth.
Fall is upon us. Now's the time to {LF}stock up for winter...although I {LF}always end up eating too much!
Tomorrow is the Monster Contest. {LF}Have you got a favorite monster you {LF}want to show off?
It's the Shooting Star Festival {LF}tomorrow. If two lovers both make {LF}a wish upon a star, then it's said {LF}it will come true!
It's getting really cold. I can hardly {LF}drag myself out of bed in the mornings!
It's the Mining Contest{LF}tomorrow. Very much a man's {LF}thing, I think.
There was another earthquake this{LF}morning, wasn't there? I'm starting {LF}to get more and more scared... Like {LF}something big is going to happen... 
Tomorrow marks the end of another year!{LF}Let's hope next year is just as good!|
Spring is the best, isn't it?
I bet you like summer,{LF}don't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Fall is no time to be dieting. {LF}Make sure you get enough to eat!
What'll we do if we get totally {LF}snowed in?!
So, tell me, what do you think {LF}of Alvarna?
What do you mean?
Well, I love this town, and I want{LF}you to feel the same way about it,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I love all the activity this town{LF}gets during the afternoon!
Why's that?
More customers, of course! Hee-hee!
Night in Alvarna is a bit...sad, {LF}isn't it? Lonely, somehow.
If only it was a bit more lively...
I totally burned breakfast yesterday. {LF}I served up charcoal instead of toast! {LF}But Dad happily ate it all anyway.
That made me happy, but I'm starting {LF}to wonder if he just doesn't have{LF}any tastebuds.
I did pretty well with lunch yesterday, {LF}if I do say so myself. Dad looked {LF}really happy when he ate it.
I totally burned dinner yesterday. {LF}A real turkey, and I don't mean {LF}the bird! But Dad happily ate it {LF}all anyway.
That made me happy, but I'm starting {LF}to wonder if he just doesn't have{LF}any tastebuds. I need to do better {LF}with tonight's meal!
I really like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
I really like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
I really like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
This isn't really something to {LF}discuss at night, though, is it?
Have you made any friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with {LF}Alicia and Ceci.
They're both really interesting.
Ceci is a half-elf. {LF}Did you know that?
Have you made any friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with {LF}Alicia and Ceci.
They're both really interesting.
Alicia's fortunes are always so crazy{LF}and fake! It's also fun to see how{LF}much Ceci's personality changes when{LF}she's being a maid.
Have you made any friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with {LF}Alicia and Cecilia.
They're both really interesting.
Alicia's weather forecasts are always {LF}spot on. Did you know that?
Did you know that Norad is {LF}the cradle of civilization? {LF}It's the birthplace of mankind!
I'd love to see the capital of Norad {LF}just once.
Did you know that Norad is {LF}the cradle of civilization? {LF}It's the birthplace of mankind!
But forget that. I'm starving. {LF}Time for lunch!
Did you know that Norad is {LF}the cradle of civilization? {LF}It's the birthplace of mankind!
I don't see how where things started{LF}out makes any difference now, {LF}though, do you?
You seem happy this morning, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Did something good happen?
I've got one for you. Alicia gave {LF}Ceci a reading and told her to {LF}"beware of water." Ceci just laughed, {LF}and didn't believe her at all.
Then I saw Alicia creeping up {LF}behind her with a bucket. {LF}I couldn't stop laughing!
Alicia's fortunes may be bogus, {LF}but her weather forecasts are {LF}always right. Strange, huh?
You seem happy this afternoon, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Did something good happen?
I've got one for you. Alicia gave {LF}Ceci a reading and told her to {LF}"beware of steps." Ceci just laughed, {LF}and didn't believe her at all.
Then I saw Alicia creeping up {LF}behind her just as Ceci started {LF}down some steps. I didn't laugh {LF}that time...
Alicia's fortunes may be bogus, {LF}but her weather forecasts are {LF}always right. Strange, huh?
Nighttime is so peaceful, don't you{LF}think, ＠カイル＠＠?
I've got one for you. Alicia gave {LF}Ceci a reading and told her to {LF}"beware of pitfalls." Ceci just laughed, {LF}and didn't believe her at all.
Then I saw Alicia digging a hole {LF}outside Ceci's house. I laughed {LF}so hard I thought my sides would split!
Alicia's fortunes may be bogus, {LF}but her weather forecasts are {LF}always right. Strange, huh?
I like ＠アイテム０＠, okay?{LF}Don't forget!
I like ＠アイテム０＠, okay? {LF}Don't forget!
I like ＠アイテム０＠, okay? {LF}Don't forget!
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}are you interested in fashion?
Fashion...? Not really.
I didn't think so. You're always {LF}wearing the same clothing, after all!
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, are you {LF}interested in fashion? Do you know {LF}what's popular in other towns?
Oh...well, I don't have any memories.{LF}So I can't really help you!
Ah, of course. Sorry!
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}are you interested in fashion?
Fashions in central Norad are quite {LF}outlandish, I've heard. Something {LF}called a "mini-skirt" is popular now.
Something like what Yue wears? {LF}But I don't think that's really {LF}my style.
Have you heard the rumors of the ghost {LF}wandering the clinic at night?
It's morning now, though, so I guess {LF}it's no fun sharing ghost stories!|
Have you heard the rumors of the ghost {LF}wandering the clinic at night?
Why do you think ghosts don't {LF}come out in the daytime?
Have you heard the rumors of the ghost {LF}wandering the clinic at night?
Sounds kind of frightening, but I think{LF}I'd like to see it sometime, too.
I really don't like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}I really wouldn't want to get that{LF}a present! Just so you know, okay?
I really don't like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}I really wouldn't want to get that{LF}a present! Just so you know, okay?
I really don't like ＠アイテム０＠. {LF}I really wouldn't want to get that{LF}a present! Just so you know, okay?
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
I didn't think so. {LF}I've never told you, after all.
You know my birthday now, right?
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
You're not the least bit interested {LF}in me?
You know my birthday now, right?
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
My birthday on the 9th of Summer. {LF}Remember that, okay?
You know my birthday now, right?
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}of me?
Ah, well...what can I say... 
Nothing much in particular.
I guess I shouldn't have asked you {LF}so early in the day.
I see.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}of me?
Ah, well...what can I say... 
Nothing much in particular.
Come on, just say it.{LF}You're a man, aren't you?
I see.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}of me?
Ah, well...what can I say... 
Nothing much in particular.
I really like you.
Come on, just say it.{LF}You're a man, aren't you?
I see.
Eh?! Wow! You just... {LF}straight up said it!
Farming means waking up early in the {LF}mornings, doesn't it?
Working the land in the afternoon {LF}looks tough.
I've never tried farming myself.{LF}How is it? Fun?
Yeah, it's fun.
Well...it's okay. 
I'm glad to hear that. Sounds like {LF}it’s the perfect job for you, ＠カイル＠＠!
I see. Maybe it doesn't really {LF}suit you, ＠カイル＠＠?
But I'm sure you'll "grow" to love it. {LF}No pun intended!
Just between me and you, don't you {LF}think Herman is kind of...oddly shaped {LF}compared to everyone else around here?
I've heard he has eight bowls of cereal {LF}every morning. But that can't be true,{LF}can it?
Just between me and you, don't you {LF}think Herman is kind of...oddly shaped {LF}compared to everyone else around here?
I've heard he has curry noodles and {LF}a massive hamburger every day {LF}for lunch. And that's just when {LF}he isn't really hungry.
Just between me and you, don't you {LF}think Herman is kind of...oddly shaped {LF}compared to everyone else around here?
He's just...too round! I'm sure he {LF}stuffs himself with snacks at night!
Are there any monsters{LF}you don't like, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Just don't get hurt fighting them, okay?
Are there any monsters{LF}you don't like, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Just don't get hurt fighting them, okay?{LF}I'm so worried.
Are there any monsters{LF}you don't like, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Just don't get hurt fighting them, okay?{LF}I'm so worried I can't sleep.
What are your plans for the future, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't decided anything yet.{LF}I'm just happy to work the soil for now.
I had a dream last night, actually. {LF}A dream that I was a teacher.
Oh, wow. You think it will come true?
I hope so. I actually really do {LF}want to become a teacher!
What are you plans for the future, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't decided anything yet.{LF}I'm just happy to work the soil for now.
It's my dream to become a teacher.
A teacher? I don't recall seeing {LF}a school in town.
That's because there isn't one. {LF}Which is a bit of a problem, isn't it?!
What are you plans for the future, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't decided anything yet.{LF}I'm just happy to work the soil for now.
A farmer...that might be nice too.
What about you, Mana?
It's my dream to become a teacher.
A teacher? I don't recall seeing {LF}a school in town.
That's because there isn't one. {LF}Which is a bit of a problem, isn't it?!
I can't help but feel that I've put on {LF}weight recently. What do you think?
You haven't changed an ounce.
Well, now that you mention it...
Really? Thanks!
Oh no! I guess I have been eating more{LF}than I should lately.
I can't help but feel that I've put on {LF}weight recently. What do you think?
You haven't changed an ounce.
Now that you mention it...
Really? Thanks!
I knew it! Oh no, what can I do? {LF}I guess a diet really is {LF}the only answer!
I can't help but feel that I've put on {LF}weight recently. What do you think?
You haven't changed an ounce.
Now that you mention it...
I'll skip dinner tonight then.
Really? Thanks!
I knew it! Oh no, what can I do? {LF}I guess a diet really is {LF}the only answer!
Boy...going without dinner is tough. {LF}I'm starving!
Hey, can I tell you something? {LF}I had a fight with Ceci.
How come?
Just a little misunderstanding.{LF}But I hate fighting with friends. {LF}I'll go and apologize to her tomorrow.
That's a good plan.
Hey, can I tell you something? {LF}I had a fight with Alicia.
How come?
I told her that her fortunes are never {LF}true.
Ouch. Well, I can see how she'd get{LF}upset at that.
Still, I was only telling the truth, {LF}Alicia's fortunes really are always {LF}wrong.
Hey, can I tell you something? {LF}I had a fight with both Alicia {LF}and Cecilia.
How come?
Its always the three of us girls {LF}together. But that can lead to some {LF}problems, sometimes.
It can?
It can, sometimes.
I'm not sure I really want to know {LF}the details, but...why not just {LF}apologize and make up?
Yeah, you're right.
Can I ask you something, {LF}＠カイル＠＠? Have you ever {LF}thought about...marriage?
Not really. Not yet.
Yes, I have.
Marriage is a strange idea, isn't it?{LF}Always living with the same person.
I see.
What?! You have?! W-W-With who?!
Ah, I can't really discuss that {LF}right now! Today's work isn't {LF}going to do itself!
You can't weasel out of this! {LF}Fess up!
Can I ask you something, {LF}＠カイル＠＠? Have you ever {LF}thought about...marriage?
Not really. Not yet.
Yes, I have.
I see.{LF}You're probably too busy{LF}thinking about lunch anyway.
What?! You have?! W-W-With who?!
Ah, I can't really discuss that {LF}right now! Today's work isn't {LF}going to do itself!
You can't weasel out of this! {LF}'Fess up!
Can I ask you something, {LF}＠カイル＠＠? Have you ever {LF}thought about...marriage?
Not really. Not yet.
Yes, I have.
I see.
What?! You have?! W-W-With who?!
Ah, well... I can't really discuss that {LF}right now! Oh boy, I think I'd better {LF}go home and get to bed!
You can't weasel out of this! {LF}'Fess up! It's far too early to go {LF}to sleep!
Hey, can you promise not to laugh {LF}if I tell you something?
Yeah...I think so.
Sometimes...in the mornings, I wake{LF}up on the floor next to my bed!
Hah hah...rolling around a little too{LF}much in your sleep, are you?
Hey! You laughed! That was a laugh, {LF}right?! You promised not to!
S-Sorry...but...hah hah hah!
Hey, can you promise not to laugh {LF}if I tell you something?
Yeah...I think so.
Sometimes...in the middle of the day, {LF}I sometimes find myself falling {LF}asleep while standing up.
Hah hah...I mean, that's okay, {LF}isn't it? Sleep when you're tired, {LF}that's my motto!
Hey! You laughed! That was a laugh,{LF}right?! You promised not to!
S-Sorry...but...hah hah hah!
Hey, can you promise not to laugh {LF}if I tell you something?
Yeah...I think so.
At night...I can't fall asleep unless {LF}I'm hugging my stuffed animal, Huggsly.{LF}Is that weird?
Hah hah... N-No, not weird at all.
Hey! You laughed! That was a laugh,{LF}right?! You promised not to!
S-Sorry...but...hah hah hah!
Hey, do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
Nope, never heard of it.
Yeah, actually, I do.
What did you have for breakfast?
There are monsters around here, right? {LF}Well the Forest of Beginnings is where {LF}they are said to have originally lived. {LF}That's all I know about it, though.
Have you ever met anyone who has been{LF}there? It sounds like a monster's{LF}paradise... But a scary place for a{LF}human to be.
I had bacon, eggs and...hey! {LF}I'm being serious here!
Hey, do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
Nope, never heard of it.
Yeah, actually, I do.
What did you have for lunch?
There are monsters around here, right? {LF}Well the Forest of Beginnings is where {LF}they are said to have originally lived. {LF}That's all I know about it, though.
Have you ever met anyone who has been{LF}there? It sounds like a monster's{LF}paradise... But a scary place for a{LF}human to be.
I had an omelet, orange juice and...{LF}hey! I'm being serious here!
Hey, do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
Nope, never heard of it.
Yeah, actually, I do.
What did you have for dinner?
There are monsters around here, right? {LF}Well the Forest of Beginnings is where {LF}they are said to have originally lived. {LF}That's all I know about it, though.
Have you ever met anyone who has been{LF}there? It sounds like a monster's{LF}paradise... But a scary place for a{LF}human to be.
I'm on a diet, so I just had a light {LF}salad and...hey! I'm being {LF}serious here!
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, is there anything {LF}about this town that you don't like?
Mayor Byron always works very hard {LF}for us. But he seems to be having {LF}some problems with his son.
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, what do {LF}you think we can do to make this {LF}town a better place?
Boy...that's a tough question.
I think, personally, that we need {LF}a school. Education is very important.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠. Is there anything {LF}about this town that you don't like?
Not really, no.
Is there something you don't like?
I see. Must be nice to be so {LF}easygoing, huh?
That didn't sound like a compliment.
It didn't? But that's how I meant it! {LF}Honest!
Really? Well, either way, {LF}just forget it. 
Well...I'd like a shop that sells {LF}fashionable clothing. I really want {LF}to try a mini-skirt on!
Farming means living as one with {LF}the land, doesn't it? I think that's {LF}a wonderful thing.
Yeah. It's not a bad way to live{LF}at all.
Waking up in the morning and taking {LF}a deep breath of that fresh air... {LF}there's nothing like it.
Whether it's sun, wind, or rain,{LF}you can really feel the life and{LF}strength of nature, can't you?
Yeah, you sure can.
Everyone complains about the weather{LF}all the time, but rain is just as{LF}important for plants as sun.
Yeah. It's all important for keeping{LF}the land happy.
When the sun goes down, {LF}you know...I feel a little sad.
You do?
The fields at night, {LF}they are a little scary, aren't they?{LF}Don't you think?
It doesn't really bother me. The night {LF}is also an essential time for vegetables {LF}to grow. They'd dry up and die if {LF}the sun shone all the time.
Have you heard of the Elder Dragon?
It's an ancient and fearsome beast. {LF}I heard it appeared in Kardia.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
Some people say there might be an{LF}Elder Dragon near here.{LF}That's kind of a scary thought...
Have you heard of the Elder Dragon?
A what dragon?
Yeah, I know all about it.
It's an ancient dragon that appeared {LF}in Kardia some years ago. The army {LF}of the Sechs Empire battled it.
Wow. That's pretty cool
It appeared in Kardia some years ago, {LF}but the army of the Sechs Empire {LF}fought it.
I was pretty surprised to learn that {LF}dragons are real! I thought they {LF}were just a legend.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}can I tell you something?
Sure. What is it?
I...I mean...I'm really happy that {LF}I met you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm happy to have met you, too.
Really? Thanks! I'm happy as long as{LF}we get to see each other every day!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}can I tell you something?
Sure. What is it?
I...I mean...I'm really happy to {LF}have met you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm happy to have met you, too.
Really? Thanks! I'm happy as long as{LF}we get to see each other every day!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}can I tell you something?
Sure. What is it?
I...I mean...I'm really happy that {LF}I met you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm happy to have met you, too.
Really? Thanks! I'm happy as long as{LF}we get to see each other every day!
＠アルス＠＠, study hard{LF}and become a fine adult.
Are you studying hard, ＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠, it's just as important{LF}to exercise as it is to study.
Have you made any friends yet, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠, Mommy's happiest{LF}spending time with you.
You're happy all the time,{LF}aren't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
I have to say, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you're becoming more and more{LF}like your father.
＠アルス＠＠, have you been{LF}doing something dangerous?
＠アルス＠＠, Mommy's happiest{LF}spending time with you.
＠アルス＠＠, you've really become{LF}a member of this town now.
I really like the sea.
Oh, you’re here already,{LF}＠カイル＠＠? We weren't{LF}supposed to meet until 6 PM.
Yeah, I just kind of found myself {LF}heading this way! But you're {LF}here too, Mana.
Yeah, I couldn't wait either... {LF}Uh, I mean, like you, I just found {LF}myself heading this way.
So, what did you want to talk about?
About that, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I wanted to ask you something.
What?
＠カイル＠＠, is there anyone you...like?
This is a little sudden, but...okay... 
I like you, Mana.
I like Julia.
I like Alicia.
I like Dorothy.
I like Cecilia.
I like Rosalind.
I like Yue.
You like too many people, ＠カイル＠＠.
There are three people you like?
So there are two. Two people you like.
I'm glad that one of them is me,{LF}though.
R-Really...? You really do like me? {LF}I'm so happy to hear you say that.
There's no one I like. Not yet.
I see... Okay, I can accept that.
I'm sorry for calling you here like {LF}this today, ＠カイル＠＠. But thanks.
I'd better be getting home, anyway. {LF}See you!
I love it when Alicia, Cecilia and I{LF}all get together and talk like this!
Yes. It's nice. But I get taken out{LF}on fabulous dates so often, it seems {LF}like we never have the time for these {LF}gatherings!
You shouldn't tell such outlandish{LF}lies, Alicia.
Hey! Don't crush my fantasies like{LF}that!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠!|{LF}What're you doing?
I've been this far before, {LF}but I've never been further than this.
I'll be right behind you. I'm counting {LF}on you to handle the monsters, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
No problem.
There's quite a few monsters in here, {LF}aren't there? I'm getting a little {LF}scared!
Hey, stay near me, will you?! {LF}You can't go running off {LF}on your own, ＠カイル＠＠.
Look at all this...!
Which country do you think {LF}that ship is from?
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. What's up?
Mana, sorry to keep you waiting.
Don't worry, I just got here too.
Come and join me then, ＠カイル＠＠.
This is all very exciting!|
I hope we get to see some {LF}good shooting stars! I'm excited, too!
I'm excited about...{LF}something else, actually.
You are?!
Oh, don't worry about that now!|
Ah! A shooting star! How beautiful!|
Yeah, I saw it too!
I have to make a wish...{LF}Oh, I can't see it any more!
Do you think another one {LF}will come along?
(I need to get closer to{LF}＠カイル＠＠...)
Ah...! Another one!
That's fast!
There's no way we can wish before{LF}they vanish! It's impossible!
Yeah.
Ah, another one!
How romantic!|
There sure are lots of them tonight.
I so happy that I could see them {LF}with you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm happy to share this {LF}with you, too, Mana.
Thanks!|
Well, shall we get going?
Yeah, okay.
Thank you for inviting me. {LF}I'll see you tomorrow, I hope, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'm so happy!
Me too.
See you, then.
Hello, darling!
Oh, "darling" just has that{LF}newlywed ring to it, doesn't it?{LF}Tee-hee!|
I'm so happy that I married you.
Are you happy that you married me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I hope we have a baby soon!|
You've been working hard again {LF}today, darling. Well done!
If I hadn't met you, I wonder what{LF}kind of life I would be living now.
Just thinking about life without{LF}you makes me sad.
I've been feeling a bit under {LF}the weather recently... {LF}My stomach feels weird...
Are you okay?
Yeah... I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm so happy to have married you!
We're going to have a baby!|
Go talk to Byron about building a{LF}school, honey! I know you can convince{LF}him!
Oh, and just to remind you, Byron {LF}only discusses town business when{LF}he's on the first floor of his{LF}house!
I hope the school will be finished {LF}soon! I'm really looking forward to it!
Today is the day the school should be{LF}finished! Let's go and see it!
Darling... Um, there's something {LF}I have to tell you...
Yes? What is it?
I think...I'm pregnant!
R-Really?! Wow! {LF}That's great, Mana!{LF}Fantastic!
I'm really happy too!
Wow, so we're going to have a baby! {LF}Do you think it'll be a boy, or a girl?
Which are you hoping for?
I'd like a son!
I'd like a daughter!
I don't care! Either is fine!
I think I'd like a son.{LF}What about you, Mana?
I think I'd like a daughter. {LF}What about you, Mana?
I'll be perfectly happy with either! {LF}What about you, Mana?
Me too!|
Great! We're going to be a family{LF}soon!
I'm so excited!
So am I! But I've got to work hard!{LF}I'm going to have to support the{LF}three of us soon!
Our baby is going to be born soon!
Honey, our baby has been born!
Wow, that's incredible, Mana!
Look! A son! And it looks like he{LF}takes after you!
Look! A daughter! And it looks like{LF}she takes after you!
Wow... I never imagined I would be{LF}a father... This is such an amazing{LF}feeling...
We need to think of a name!{LF}The most wonderful, perfect name!
＠アルス＠＠...?{LF}Yes, that's a great name!{LF}I love it!
Good, we've already settled on a name!
＠アルス＠＠, remember to eat well so {LF}you can grow up healthy and strong!
Hmmm... Growing up...
What is it?
I was just thinking that we'll need a{LF}school for ＠アルス＠＠ to go to...
You're right...
Now that our baby has been born, {LF}I'll try talking to Byron about {LF}building a school.
Great! Let me know how it goes,{LF}honey!
Sure thing!
Oh, is something wrong, honey?
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠. It's rare to see {LF}you in here. Do you need something?
It's summer! You should be playing {LF}happily outside!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠. Anything I can {LF}help you with today?
It's cold again today, {LF}isn't it, ＠アルス＠＠!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Here for a little shopping?
I've got a special on summer seeds {LF}today, ＠アルス＠＠.
Fall is well and truly, well, {LF}falling, isn't it, ＠アルス＠＠?!
Is school fun, ＠アルス＠＠?
It makes me so glad to see you {LF}looking so happy every day, ＠アルス＠＠!
It's nice to see that you've got a{LF}suntan from playing outside {LF}so much, ＠アルス＠＠!
Fall is the time to eat and {LF}grow strong, ＠アルス＠＠.
There's no stopping children! {LF}You must play outside, {LF}even if it's snowing!
Learn hard and play hard again {LF}today, ＠アルス＠＠!
It's nice to see that you've got a{LF}suntan from playing outside {LF}so much, ＠アルス＠＠!
Fall is a good season for learning. {LF}Study hard, ＠アルス＠＠.
In winter you can study indoors or {LF}play outside. Which do you prefer, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Nothing beats a nice, relaxing bath.
A bath in summer is the best!
A bath in fall just feels so good.
A bath marks the perfect end to {LF}a long, cold day. I think an outside {LF}bath would be even better, as long{LF}as the water was really hot!
Reverend Gordon's sermons {LF}are pretty interesting, you know.
The church has a high roof, {LF}so it never gets that hot in here.
I think you are almost old enough{LF}to listen to my sermons, ＠アルス＠＠.
The air inside this church in winter {LF}is so crisp and tingly. I love it.
Sometimes just strolling {LF}through town can be fun.
Do you like this town, ＠アルス＠＠?
I can't help feeling that this town {LF}is very...wide. It's all in {LF}a straight line! Don't you think {LF}so too, ＠アルス＠＠?
The town looks lovely when it's {LF}covered with snow. Don't you agree, {LF}＠アルス＠＠? I used to love {LF}playing in the snow when I was small.
Take lesson.
Get a magic book repaired.
Don't need anything.
All right, let's begin the class!
Listen carefully and be sure to {LF}take notes! This will all be on {LF}the test!
I'm going to teach a cooking lesson.
I'll write a recipe on the board. {LF}Be sure to note it down!
However, until the Workshop is{LF}done being built, you won't have{LF}anywhere to practice making these{LF}recipes.
Really? That's a shame!
We'll just have to study theory hard{LF}until the Workshop is finished.
We will?
I hope the classroom is finished {LF}soon, then!
I like your lessons, Ma'am, {LF}so I can live with that.
Is that so?
We'll just have to study theory hard{LF}until the Workshop is finished.
Okay!
Studying can be fun, too.
A little studying in advance {LF}can never hurt!
(So Dad didn't get the chance to finish{LF}building the school. Well, I'll just{LF}have to do it myself!)
(So Dad didn't get the chance to finish{LF}building the school. Well, I'll just{LF}have to do it myself!)
That's all for today. {LF}I'll see you again tomorrow.
That's all for today. {LF}I'll see you again next week.
＠アルス＠＠, have you been {LF}playing dangerous games?
＠アルス＠＠, you've really grown up{LF}a lot all of a sudden!
I've heard you've been going outside{LF}of the town a lot recently, ＠アルス＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠, are you hiding something?
It's been so peaceful recently, {LF}hasn't it ＠アルス＠＠?
I knew that Dad would come back! {LF}It's just like you said, Mom!
I heard that ＠カイル＠＠ has returned. {LF}That's great news, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠! You look happy today!
I feel great today!| {LF}Just like every day!
Every single day is so much fun. {LF}I bet you think the same thing, {LF}don't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You want me to repair a magic book {LF}for you? That shouldn't be a problem.
However, you'll need to bring me both {LF}the book you want repaired and {LF}the right MISSING PAGE. I can only{LF}repair the MISSING PAGES in order.

Oh, ＠アルス＠＠. That book is {LF}already completely repaired. {LF}What do you want me to do, {LF}write a new chapter?
Well, it was worth a try!
Well, it was worth a try!
I've told you this once already. I can't{LF}do any more repairs to this book! 
(I can't help feeling...{LF}it isn't the right time yet.)
(I'll hold off for now...)
＠アイテム９＠ was placed{LF}in your backpack.
Did you want something, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
N-No, nothing in particular!
Wow, what a beautiful ring! {LF}Is that...for me...?
Yes, Julia. Take a closer look at it.
Hey, isn't this...?!
That's right. I had the ore we found {LF}together made into this ring.
I wanted you to wear it as a memento {LF}of that time that just the two of us {LF}shared.
This is... Oh, don't tell me...{LF}Are you...?
I'm proposing.
I'm just showing the ring off.
This is how I feel about you, Julia.
I want to be with you, Julia.
Huh? You are! You're...proposing!
Yes. I love you, Julia. {LF}Will you marry me?
Hm... Marry you?
Well, this is a little sudden...
Hey, just don't get mad at me.
Oh, you fool...!
But... {LF}Thank you... 
I'll make you happy, I swear it. {LF}Will you marry me?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}Yes!
What?! You're just teasing me?{LF}I didn't know you could be so cruel, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Go on! Get out of here!
You took the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}back.
This is how I feel about you, Julia.
H-Hold it... Where's this all going...?
I'm not sure about my own feelings yet.
I can't take this... {LF}Not right now.
The ＠アイテム９＠ was returned to you.
Is that for me? Thanks!
That's for me? What a tasty looking {LF}salad!| Thanks!|
Wow! You got me a salad?!|
Great! This is just what I wanted!
Perfect! Just what I wanted! {LF}You've got great intuition, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad you're happy.
But Douglas thinks{LF}I'm the one who's going to eat it.
He kept telling me that salads are{LF}for sissies.
Oh dear! How terrible for you! {LF}You went through all of that for me?
You have my gratitude.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Here's something for you!|
You got: ＠アイテム７＠!
Why not try using that on your crops? {LF}It should do them some good!
Thank you.
Great!| I knew I could count on you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!| See you soon!
Oh, it looks like your backpack is {LF}full. You'd better make some {LF}room first!
That's for me? What a tasty looking {LF}salad!| Thanks!|
That's for me? But I don't really feel{LF}like eating that right now...
Just...what were you thinking...?
Ah...I'm sorry. {LF}Douglas really insisted that I take{LF}this.
Hold it! You seriously think {LF}I'm going to eat that?!
Do you want me to put on weight?!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, you moron!
I can't bear to look at you right now, {LF}＠カイル＠＠! Just get out of here!
Sorry...
That's for me? But I don't really feel {LF}like eating that right now...
That's for me? Thanks!| {LF}I'll treasure it always!|
Oh, you found Mayor Byron's{LF}＠アイテム９＠?
I think so. It looks like it to me.
Great, ＠カイル＠＠!
Thank you soooooo much!
I'll take care of delivering this{LF}to the mayor.
Which means you can take {LF}all the credit for it...
Thanks so much, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}You really helped me out!
Here's your reward!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
They're healthy and delicious!|
See you later!
Oh, it looks like your backpack is {LF}full. You'd better make some {LF}room first!
That's for me? Thanks!| {LF}I'll treasure it always!|
I didn't think you'd actually be able {LF}to get a hold of it! You're amazing, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
You really mean it...?
Of course! {LF}I believe in you, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}Totally!
Is that so...?
I've never seen something like this {LF}before, either. Have you?
Just looking at it, I know it's{LF}going to work!
Yeah. I can feel massive power {LF}radiating from it. It's really{LF}unique!
Okay, I'm gonna put it on display!
But actually...
I haven't given any thought to {LF}where to display it!
Ah ha ha ha...
I don't have anywhere to put it {LF}right now.
After all that hard work getting {LF}my hands on it, too...!
Ah well. You can have it, ＠カイル＠＠!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
You're sure about this? {LF}I can just have it?
Turns out I don't have an use {LF}for it myself.
If you've got any idea what you could {LF}use it for, ＠カイル＠＠, go for it!
Okay...well I'd certainly like to {LF}put it to use. It wasn't easy {LF}to find, after all... 
Okay. I'll take it. I just hope {LF}I can find a use for it!
Great! Let me know what you do {LF}with it!
But we haven't solved the problem {LF}with your bathhouse...
Oh, don't worry! We can do that {LF}next time!|
Ah ha ha!
(Still, I'm not exactly sure{LF}what to do with this ore.)
(I can't just throw it away,{LF}but what should I do?)
(Yue's been all over the place. She{LF}might know what I can do with this.)
(I'll show it to her later.)
Oh, it looks like your backpack is {LF}full. You'd better make some {LF}room first!
＠アイテム９＠ was returned.
It's a gift from me, so you'd better {LF}hold onto it!
Don't go throwing it away or anything {LF}like that!
＠アイテム９＠ was returned.
(What should I do with this?)
(Yue's seen many things.{LF}She might know what I can use this for.)
(I'll show it to her later.)
Oh, that's for me? This is great for {LF}the skin when added to bath water.
Ah, you got it for me!|
Now I can put as much in my bath {LF}as I like! Thanks!
Here's your reward!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks!| I'll call on you again{LF}if I need some more help!
This is for me? Oh, this is great {LF}for beautiful skin! Thanks!|
Wow!!! A ＠アイテム９＠! It's even more{LF}beautiful than I imagined!|
This is amazing... I... I think {LF}I'm going to cry!
Thank you soooo much, ＠アルス＠＠!|{LF}Here's your reward!|
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Now to see if eating this really{LF}works! Thank you so much, ＠アルス＠＠!|
This is for me? Oh, this is great for {LF}beautiful skin! Thanks!|
Oh, this is for me? It looks great. {LF}And very healthy, too! Thanks!|
A delivery from Dorothy? That's very {LF}grown up of you, ＠アルス＠＠!
Thank you for this!| Be sure to thank {LF}Dorothy for me, too!|
I will!
I will!
Oh, that looks delicious!|
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠!|
That smells great!| Is that for me?
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠!|
Ugh! I don't need anything{LF}this ugly! Ugh! Ugh!
Are you trying to upset me?
Julia, will you try a sip of this drink?
What's this? Can I drink it?
*gulp*
................
Hmmm, something seems different...
Hmm... I don't know why, but {LF}whenever I look at your face,{LF}I suddenly feel really warm, and...
Hey, don't look at me like that!{LF}It's your fault!
(Judging by the effects, it looks{LF}like this medicine's the real thing.)
Julia, please try this.
What's this? Can I drink it?
*gulp*
................
Hmmm, something seems different...
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}Thank you for everything.{LF}I'm really really grateful to you.
You're a great guy!|
(Judging by the effects, it looks{LF}like this medicine's the real thing.)
Hey! This is my favorite food!
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Ahhh, these smell good|{LF}Are they for me?
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Eww! I don't want this!{LF}It's so...weird!
Are you trying to get me upset?
Here, try this.
Here, try this.
What's this? Can I drink it?
*gulp*
................
Hmmm, something seems different...
It's good to see{LF}you looking so healthy, ＠アルス＠＠.
(Judging by the effects, it looks{LF}like this medicine's the real thing.)

I don't really want to eat{LF}something so fattening right{LF}now. If it were my birthday{LF}or something it'd be different.

I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Thank you.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Thank you.
I want to talk.
I want to take a bath.
I'm fine for now.
Come again!
Welcome!|
Welcome!|
Welcome!|
Welcome!|
Aren't the baths here lovely?{LF}They're my pride and joy!
I'm sure you sweat a lot{LF}on hot days, don't you?{LF}Well, you can always {LF}refresh yourself in my baths!
You've been spending less time{LF}in the bath since the {LF}weather's cooled down.
Hm? What about me?{LF}I'm always in there for a long time?{LF}Well, I guess, but..
There's nothing like a bath{LF}on a cold day.
If you get into one of my baths,{LF}you can kiss the shivers goodbye!
Isn't it great that this place{LF}is always doing so well?
Isn't it great that this place{LF}is always doing so well?
Isn't it great that this place{LF}is always doing so well?
Isn't it great that this place{LF}is always doing so well?
It's so nice outside, isn't it?{LF}So, what should we do?!
Sunscreen protects your skin{LF}when you're outdoors.
I make sure not to miss any spots when{LF}I'm applying sunscreen!
Hmm, maybe I should start using{LF}a little less sunscreen.
Brr, it's cold, isn't it?!
The truth is, I've got a couple{LF}extra layers of clothing on.
Teehee.
Sure the ocean breeze feels{LF}great, but if you don't take{LF}good care of your hair, you'll{LF}be in a world of trouble later.
It's so sparkly!
I can't open my eyes when the {LF}sunlight is being reflected like that.
The air feels good, doesn't it?{LF}The harbor is so nice now that the{LF}weather has cooled down.
Watch your step so you don't{LF}slip and fall into the ocean!{LF}I know you love trying {LF}dangerous things.
I don't do that kind of thing.
It feels like the whole world is{LF}in harmony when you're in the{LF}church.
Don't you think so too?
Everything feels so oddly{LF}peaceful when you're{LF}in the church.
I can see where Dorothy gets{LF}her quiet personality.
Oh, but Cammy is different... {LF}so I guess the church has {LF}nothing to do with it.{LF}
The church feels like it should{LF}be a quiet place, but
whenever Cammy and Roy{LF}show up, the whole atmosphere{LF}changes, doesn't it?
Those two are always so loud wherever {LF}they go. It's really a problem.
See that piano by the side of the altar?{LF}Dorothy comes and plays for everyone{LF}sometimes. She's really good.
Even if you're not really paying{LF}attention, the music just draws you in.
Fancy seeing you here!
Us girls get together{LF}here a lot!
You've got some nerve trying{LF}to break into a group of girls{LF}like this!
There's something really calming{LF}about Dorothy's room, isn't there?
We're talking about girl stuff{LF}right now, so no boys allowed!
Every spring I'm just overwhelmed{LF}with things I want to do!{LF}
I don't really want to go outside.{LF}It's so hot out there!
There's so much yummy food in {LF}the fall. You have to be{LF}extra careful not to get fat.
It may be cold outside, but{LF}inside it's nice and warm.
Leave the housework to me!|
Leave the housework to me!|
Leave the housework to me!|
Leave the housework to me!|
Hello, sweetie!
Teehee, now that we're married,{LF}I get to call you "sweetie".
Tee-hee! I'm really happy now,{LF}sweetie!|
Darling, how much do you love me?
I wonder if we'll have a baby soon.
Darling, you work so hard for us{LF}every day. When you're at home,{LF}rest up and get refreshed!
I love the bath, but I love you{LF}more, darling.
I love you, darling. Let's{LF}be happy together.
Sometimes I just feel a little{LF}sick. I wonder what's wrong.
Are you okay?
Yes... I think I'm fine.
I hope this happiness lasts forever.
I wonder if we'll have a baby soon.
Darling, put your all into building{LF}the school. For the children's sake.
Try talking to Byron when he's at {LF}home on the first floor.
Won't it be great if the school is{LF}finished soon?
The school's going to be finished {LF}soon. I'm so excited!
Um, darling, I have something{LF}really important to tell you.
What is it?
Well...it looks like I'm going{LF}to have a baby.
R-R-Really?{LF}That's so great! I'm so happy, Julia.
I'm happy, too!|
Wow, so we're having a baby...{LF}I wonder if it'll be boy or a girl.
Heehee... Which do you think{LF}would be better?
A boy would be better.
A girl would be better.
Either would be wonderful.
Hmm, I guess I think a boy{LF}would be better. What about you?
Hmm, I guess I think a girl{LF}would be better. What about you?
I think that either would be wonderful.{LF}What about you?
Tee-hee!| I feel the same way.
Well, I guess our family's{LF}getting bigger, isn't it?
Yup. Give it your all from here{LF}on out too, darling!
Of course!
Darling, it looks like the baby{LF}is going to be born soon!
Darling, the baby was born{LF}safe and healthy!
That's wonderful, Julia!
It's a boy. Look! He looks{LF}just like you!
It's a girl. Look! She looks{LF}just like you!
Aww...
Well, we have to think of a name.{LF}Think of something nice, okay?
＠アルス＠＠? Ooh, what a pretty name! {LF}I really like it!
That's good.
Eat well, ＠アルス＠＠, so{LF}you'll grow up to be strong{LF}and healthy!
*sigh* He's already growing...
Is there something wrong?
Well, yes. He's going to {LF}need a school.
He will, won't he...?
I'm going to go talk {LF}to Byron about everything{LF}and see if maybe we can {LF}have a school built.
Good idea! Give it all{LF}you've got, darling.{LF}For ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah!
It's hard to think about what{LF}lies ahead, isn't it?
It's hard to think about what{LF}lies ahead, isn't it?
It's hard to think about what{LF}lies ahead, isn't it?
It's hard to think about what{LF}lies ahead, isn't it?
Sorry to keep you waiting, Julia.
I was waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠!|{LF}I wonder if we'll be able to really{LF}see the shooting stars.
Let's move somewhere where{LF}they'll be easier to see!
I'm nervous!|
Me too. I'm wondering when the{LF}stars are going to show up.
Well, there's something else{LF}making me nervous but...
Huh?
Oh, nothing!|
Ah! I just saw one!
So pretty!
Wow, they're so beautiful!
Ah, of course! I have to{LF}make a wish.
I wonder if it will show up again...
"I wish I were pretti..."
*sigh* It's gone already.
It disappeared so quickly.
It's hard to fit in a whole wish{LF}before it disappears, isn't it?
It really is.
If only I had a little more time.{LF}Then I could really make it a good{LF}one.
Hah, if only.
Aren't you going to make one too?
No, I'm happy just watching.
Hey, that's kind of cold...
Ahh, all this wishing has made me tired.
They're so beautiful!
This is so romantic!|
This is really amazing. I never thought{LF}I'd see so many shooting stars.
I'm so happy I got to see{LF}them with you.
I'm happy I got to see{LF}them with you too.
Teehee!|
Well, I'm getting kind of chilly.{LF}Let's go home!|
Let's. I think we've seen{LF}enough of the stars for tonight.
Thanks so much for inviting me{LF}today! See you later!|
I'm really happy that I got to {LF}see them with you. Well, on that note,{LF}good night, Julia.
Bye-bye!|
Hey! I don't think I've seen{LF}you around here before! {LF}Who are you?
My name's ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Nice to meet you.{LF}
Ahhh, really?! I'm Julia. {LF}I run the baths in this town.{LF}Stop by sometime!
When you step into one{LF}of my baths, you get{LF}100 times healthier. It's true!{LF}
Really?
Really! So make sure {LF}to come to my baths{LF}every day!
Morning!|
Hi! Afternoon!
Good evening!|
Ah, good morning!|
Ah, hello!|
Ah, good evening!|
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠!
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠!
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I get so lonely whenever I don't{LF}get to see you.
Hi! Afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I get so lonely whenever I don't{LF}get to see you.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I get so lonely whenever I don't{LF}get to see you.
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hi. Afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}How're you doing?
Good evening. {LF}Are you still up, ＠アルス＠＠?
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}
The new year really makes{LF}you just want to go do{LF}something, doesn't it?
I'm going to make my resolutions!
Hahaha. The new year has really{LF}gotten you excited hasn't it, Julia?
Teehee.
First off, I want to make my{LF}skin a little nicer and improve {LF}my fashion sense.
After that, I went to spend{LF}more time in the bath!
Ah, I have so much to do!
Hmm, it seems like it's going{LF}to be a really busy year, doesn't it?{LF}What with that and all.
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}Flowers are just so pretty, aren't they?
I want to go see!{LF}Do you like flowers too, ＠カイル＠＠?
Hm? Well, yes, I guess so.
Well, the Flower Festival's really just{LF}a reason to have a big party, but...
Ahh, that sounds fun. {LF}By the way, Julia...
Want to go see the flowers with me?
Aren't the blossoms pretty?
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}Flowers are just so pretty, aren't they?
Julia, do you want to go{LF}and see the flowers with me?
Oh, you're inviting me?{LF}That sounds great!|
Okay, so let's meet at{LF}＠マップ９＠.
I don't think it's such a great{LF}thing to keep inviting people to the{LF}Flower Festival one after {LF}another like that...
They're so pretty. The pink{LF}is just so cute.
The Flower Festival really{LF}just feels like another party,{LF}doesn't it?
I'm going soon, too, so go to{LF}＠マップ９＠ first!|
The Flower Festival was so{LF}much fun!|
Today is the Flower Festival.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, have you seen the {LF}cherry blossoms yet?
Today's the Eating Contest!{LF}You're competing, of course.{LF}Right, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh?! Why "of course"?!
Hmm, don't feel like competing?{LF}It would be really exciting to{LF}watch you win!
Wow! ＠カイル＠＠, you can do anything!{LF}I'm really impressed!
Ahh, so you lost?{LF}If you'd just pushed yourself{LF}a little bit harder...
There's a festival today!{LF}Have a good time, ＠アルス＠＠!
Wow, it looks like you really{LF}gave it all you had. {LF}Congratulations, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh well, so you didn't get it this time.{LF}Don't let it get you too down.
Ah, today's the start of swimming{LF}season. You know what feels good after {LF}swimming? A nice, long bath!
Ahaha. What about you, Julia?{LF}Are you going in the water?
Welllll, if I were going in, I'd{LF}have to cover myself in sunscreen,{LF}so I don't really think I want to.
It's the start of swimming season!{LF}But I'm afraid of getting sunburned, {LF}so I'm going to have to pass...
Today's the Monster Taming Contest!
If you compete, I'll cheer for you!
You did it! I didn't have any idea{LF}you were so good with monsters!
Taming monsters must be really hard!{LF}Oh well, maybe next time.
Today's festival is a little bit{LF}dangerous, so I think it's best{LF}you don't compete, okay, ＠アルス＠＠?
Wow, you did it!{LF}I didn't think you'd be able to.
What a shame...{LF}Are you hurt or anything?
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}Are you thinking of inviting anyone?
Please come dance with me.
Um, no, I'm fine.
Huh? You want to dance with me? {LF}Sure! It'll be fun!
I'm really happy that you thought{LF}to invite me, but I've already got{LF}plans for today. I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh... Really?
I had a good time today.{LF}I'll remember it forever.{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm so sorry! And you went out{LF}of your way for me too. I was happy{LF}you thought to invite me, though.
Did you enjoy the dance? I had a great{LF}time with my partner.
It's the Dance Festival today!{LF}How about you try inviting someone{LF}too, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Fishing Contest.
Me, I'm happy enough just EATING fish.
Wow!{LF}Looks like you caught a big one!
Maybe next time you'll{LF}catch one for me, too...
Ah, better luck next time.
Today's the Big Cook-Off! I hope{LF}they make some nice, healthy food...
Your food looked so good, ＠アルス＠＠.
Looks like it didn't work out{LF}this time. Oh well.
It's the Adventure Contest today!{LF}But I think I'll pass. After all,{LF}adventuring and stuff can{LF}get pretty dangerous.
Hahaha. Yeah, it definitely sounds{LF}a little scary if you're not used{LF}to dealing with monsters.
But it shouldn't be any problem for{LF}you, right? You'll win it for sure!
You're amazing, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}From now on, if there's anything{LF}I need done, I'll be{LF}sure to ask you!
That looked like it was absolutely{LF}positively impossible for you.{LF}You're not suited to be an adventurer,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
It's the Adventure Contest today!{LF}But I think I'll pass. After all, {LF}adventuring and stuff can{LF}get pretty dangerous.
Woooow! You didn't do anything too{LF}dangerous, did you?
What a shame...{LF}But still, what's most important{LF}is that you got home safe.
Today's the Harvest Festival!{LF}I'm so grateful that we always{LF}have good food to eat!
And it's only through the grace of the{LF}soil that we're able to keep farming.{LF}We really have to be thankful,{LF}or else...
I'm very thankful to you as well,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Ahaha, no thanks necessary.
Today's the Harvest Festival!{LF}We must be thankful for the{LF}gifts of the land.
It's the Monster Contest today!{LF}Come to think of it, maybe the{LF}monsters could use a bath too...
Hmm, it doesn't really seem like{LF}they would, but maybe they do...
Never taking a bath... They must{LF}be so dirty! Maybe I'll teach them{LF}all about the wonders of a bath.
Wow, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I was so surprised!
Oh well, so you lost. Are you{LF}feeling okay today? {LF}Either way, just be sure {LF}to give it your all next time.
Today's the Monster Contest!{LF}But aren't monsters kind of{LF}scary?
Go for it, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Just be sure not to bring{LF}any monsters too close to me!
What a shame. But still, you're{LF}pretty good with monsters. I'm{LF}too scared even to touch them.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Isn't it romantic?
Want to go look at the stars together?
Uh, never mind.
Is that an invitation?{LF}Hmmm...
Okay!{LF}I'll go see the stars with you, ＠カイル＠＠.
So let's meet at {LF}＠マップ９＠ at{LF}9:00 tonight, okay? I'll be waiting{LF}for you, so don't stand me up!
Thanks for the invitation,{LF}but I've already made plans to go see{LF}them with someone else. Sorry.{LF}Maybe next time?
Hmph. Well if you don't have{LF}anything to say to me, you should{LF}probably go somewhere else.
I wonder if we'll be able to see{LF}any shooting stars. Make sure to{LF}go to ＠マップ９＠ {LF}at 9:00 tonight!
I'm getting really excited, so{LF}don't forget!
I'm sorry we couldn't go together.{LF}Try inviting me again next year?
I had so much fun today! We could see{LF}the stars so perfectly and everything.{LF}I know I'll remember this night forever.{LF}
Thank you for inviting me, ＠カイル＠＠.
The Shooting Star Festival only comes{LF}once a year.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival!{LF}You should invite someone to go{LF}watch the stars with you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}How about you try your hand at it, {LF}＠カイル＠＠? You might be able{LF}to dig up something really nice!
Hmm, I'm no good with a hammer.{LF}I'm not really used to using one.
Well, it'd be totally impossible for{LF}me! Still, if you dig up some jewels,{LF}think of me!
You did it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Let's see what you brought back!
*sigh* Guess it didn't go too well.{LF}Don't let it get you too down, okay?
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}Aren't you a maybe just a little{LF}too young, ＠アルス＠＠?
Wow! You may be small, but{LF}you sure impressed me!
Ah, oh well. So it's still a little{LF}early for you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Today is New Year's Eve.
A lot happened this year, didn't it? {LF}I hope next year's nice, too.
Same here, Julia.
I'm working hard to make sure{LF}next year turns out great too!{LF}Let's work at it together, ＠カイル＠＠!
Wow, the year is ending today.{LF}I hope next year's just as good!
Ah, you're here!
Yep! What do you want me to do?
Yep! What do you want me to do?
Well, I want you to get some{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me.
It's really good for your skin if{LF}you put it in the bath!
But, unfortunately, my supply{LF}just ran out!
So, if it's not too much trouble,{LF}could you go and get some for me?
No problem! I'll do it!
No problem! I'll do it!
Really? Thanks!|
Go and get some ＠アイテム９＠{LF}for me, please!|
Hey, it looks like you got it!{LF}Give it here!|
Ah, you made it! Well, this is{LF}kind of sudden, but can you do{LF}me a favor?
Can you give this ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Rosalind for me?
I made it on a whim just to see if{LF}I could, but I don't really like{LF}potatoes...
It would be a shame to see it just{LF}go to waste, though, so I want{LF}Rosalind to have it!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Please make sure to give the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Rosalind for{LF}me. Thanks!|
Ah, you did it!
You really helped me out.{LF}Here's something for your{LF}trouble!|
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you!|
Hi, Julia. I saw the bulletin board.{LF}What do you need?
Hi, Julia! I saw the bulletin board.{LF}What do you need?
Ah, thanks for coming!{LF}Gosh! I'm always causing you{LF}so much trouble!
Anyway, I've got another favor to{LF}ask of you. This one might be{LF}a little bit trickier, though...
I want a ＠アイテム９＠!
It's a kind of pumpkin, but it's{LF}usually pretty hard to get your{LF}hands on!
But it's supposed to be soooo good{LF}for maintaining your beauty!
Like, a hundred times better than{LF}any other food!
So, I want to try one!
Do you think you can help me out?
Hmmm... Sounds like it could{LF}be hard to find, but I'll give{LF}it a shot!
Hmmm... Sounds like it could{LF}be hard to find, but I'll give{LF}it a shot!
Thank you so much, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Please try to find a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}for me! Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Ahhh! Is this the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}I've been wanting for for so long?
Wow... I must say, I'm{LF}kind of impressed.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Here's a little something{LF}for you!|
You got ＠数字９＠G!
With this, I'll definitely look{LF}amazing. Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver! Thanks again!|
You're a lifesaver!{LF}I know I can always count{LF}on you.
Making good bath soap is hard, isn't it?
So is dieting... You can't really{LF}just let loose and enjoy yourself.
It's my responsibility, so I'll {LF}be sure to hand it over.{LF}Thanks.
I guess my laws of beauty are a bit{LF}too tough for the average person.
What you said has kind of{LF}encouraged me. Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Treat it well! Don't throw it{LF}away or anything!
Thanks, you're a lifesaver!|
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.
Thank you!| If this helps my{LF}beauty even a little bit, it'll{LF}be worth it!
Is there anything wrong, Julia?{LF}I'm on town patrol right now.
Something wrong? No, not really.
Well, that's good to hear!
I saw your message on the board.
You're here to help me? Thank you!
It's nothing. So, what do you{LF}need me to deliver?
Can you bring this ＠アイテム９＠ {LF}to Gordon for me?
I can't believe he would forget{LF}something so important.
He's kind of a blockhead, isn't he?
Yeah, you would think his scriptures{LF}would be really important to him.
And, I mean, it's pretty thick and{LF}heavy and all. Could he really{LF}forget something like that?
I know! I can't believe it.
Anyway, I'm sorry to trouble{LF}you, but would give this to him for me?
You got the ＠アイテム９＠.
No problem. Leave it to me!
I can always count on you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}As always, thank you.
Make sure to give the ＠アイテム９＠ {LF}to Gordon for me.
Welcome back, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Did you deliver that book to{LF}Gordon for me?
Yes. Gordon told me to thank{LF}you for him.
Ahh, it was no problem.{LF}I think that we should both{LF}be thanking you!
It was really nothing.  If you ever{LF}need anything else, I'm always{LF}happy to help.
You're so reliable!{LF}Ah, yes, your reward. Here you go!
You got a ＠アイテム８＠.
Thank you.
I went ahead and made a {LF}little too much, so I'll{LF}give some to you!|
See you later.
Ah, it looks like you're carrying{LF}a lot. Lighten up your load a bit!
I saw your message, Julia.
You came so quickly!|{LF}I knew I could count on{LF}you to help me out!
Anyhow, if you're wondering what{LF}I need you to do, have a look at this.
Isn't this...
just a plain old sword?
Tanya left it here.
Isn't this a little dangerous to{LF}just leave lying around?
Hah. It's probably less dangerous{LF}lying around than it is in Tanya's{LF}hands!
She was actually trying to{LF}demonstrate a sword fighting{LF}technique in the bath! She terrified{LF}all my other customers!
Anyway, I'd be grateful if you{LF}could return the sword to Tanya{LF}for me.
Hmmm...
Thanks! You're so kind!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
You're a great guy, ＠カイル＠＠.
(And so cute, too!)
Hm? Did you say something just now?
Huh, oh, no! Don't mind me at all!{LF}See you later, ＠カイル＠＠.
Make sure to give the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Tanya{LF}for me! I'm counting on{LF}you!|
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. Did you bring the{LF}＠アイテム９＠　to Tanya?
Yeah. She really missed it.{LF}She told me to thank you for her.
Tee-hee! That's nice!
I'm always such a bother, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thank you for taking the time to{LF}help me out.
Don't worry about it.
If you ever have any more{LF}trouble, just let me know.
I will.
You're so great, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thank you, and here's a little{LF}token of my appreciation.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you.
It's the seed of an herb{LF}that I really like. If you{LF}plant it, maybe you can{LF}give a little of it to me!|
Okay, see you later!
Ah, it looks like you're carrying{LF}a lot. Lighten up your load a bit.
Julia, I saw your message on{LF}the board. You said that you've{LF}got some new soap?
Ah, you saw it. Yup, I decided to{LF}change things up a bit, but I'm{LF}not sure if it was the right choice.
It's this soap. You can smell just{LF}the faintest touch of herbs.
It smells really nice.
Doesn't it?! Go ahead -- give it a try{LF}and let me know what you think.
Okay, I'll give it a shot... {LF}*scrub scrub*
How is it?
Hmm, well...
It feels nice.
It's not so great.
I think it feels really nice.
Yaaaaaay! Thank you!|
It was hard work bringing{LF}out this smell!
*sigh* Making soap is so hard.
And I can't keep on making{LF}things if nobody says{LF}anything nice about them.
Hahaha, it kind of sounds like you're{LF}making things just so people{LF}will praise you...
No, that's not it at all!
I'm just trying to make soaps that{LF}will make my customers happy!
Being praised is the last thing{LF}on my mind!
Really?
Really!
I see...
...
You know what, it's fine.{LF}At any rate, thanks for letting me{LF}know what you think! Here, here's{LF}a little something for your troubles.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
It's really tasty, so I'm sure{LF}you'll enjoy it!
Oh yes, and here's some wood.
I figured you might be able to{LF}find some use for it.
You got 100 pieces of wood!
Thank you.
Okay, I'll be counting on you{LF}if I ever need help again!
It's not that great, right?
Liar! Did you really{LF}try it out? I'm actually{LF}quite proud of it, but...
Well, after I washed myself{LF}off, I wasn't really all that{LF}much cleaner. I mean, it{LF}smells nice, but...
Hmm, really?{LF}I probably put too much work into{LF}the fragrance...
And didn't concentrate enough{LF}on making it clean well.
Ah, that makes sense.{LF}It's a tough balance to strike.
Still... 
I can't just keep making{LF}things if people don't say nice{LF}things about them. I mean, I{LF}put a lot of effort into this...
Huh?! Really? Wow, I'm sorry...
Whatever, it's fine. I just{LF}won't ask you from now on.
Ah... I'm sorry.
Either way, you took the time{LF}to show up, so here's a little{LF}something for your trouble.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
It's really tasty, so I hope you{LF}like it.
Ah, oh yes, and here's some wood.
I figured you might be able to{LF}find some use for it.
You got 100 pieces of wood.
Thank you.
Okay, see you around.
Ah, it looks like your backpack{LF}is full. Maybe you can lighten it up{LF}a bit for me?
This is a little token of my appreciation.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
It's really tasty, so I hope you{LF}like it.
Ah, oh yes, and here's some wood.
I figured you might be able to{LF}find some use for it.
You got 100 pieces of wood.
Thank you.
Okay, I'll be counting on you{LF}if I ever need help again!
I saw your message on the board, Julia.{LF}Is there something I can help you with?
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠, you saw my{LF}message. Okay, this is kind of{LF}short notice but...
Yes?
Could you maybe run over to{LF}Douglas' store and get me {LF}something nice and healthy to eat?
You know that I'm really careful{LF}when it comes to matters of beauty, {LF}right? Well, a very important part{LF}of that is making sure you eat right.
But it's really hard to put energy{LF}into cooking healthy, balanced meals{LF}every single day.
Sometimes I just can't find the time.{LF}When that happens, I just buy{LF}something from Douglas' store.
Sure. That makes sense. You can't{LF}always find the time to cook.
You get me so well, ＠カイル＠＠!|
Tell Douglas I sent you. I think{LF}he'll be able to help you out.
Make sure it's healthy!{LF}See you later!|
Go to Douglas' store and get{LF}me some healthy food, please!|
It'll really help me out.
Julia, I saw the bulletin board.{LF}What's up? You said you were having{LF}some trouble.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I was waiting for you.{LF}Okay, so...
The mayor asked me to do{LF}him a favor and look for something{LF}he dropped and...
I was thinking maybe you could{LF}help me out.
I was just hanging around the {LF}mayor and he asked me to{LF}do him a favor...
And it looked like he was having{LF}a really hard time and I just couldn't{LF}say no. So I told him okay.{LF}
But honestly, I'm kind of busy{LF}over here right now, so I can't really{LF}help him out myself.
Which is why I was thinking{LF}that maybe you could help me?
Help you? Heh, It sounds suspiciously {LF}like you're just asking me to do it{LF}for you.
Hmm, maybe you're right.{LF}But either way, you look free,{LF}so you'll do it, right?
Sure. Why not?
Yay! You're the best, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're always helping me out.
So, what exactly is he looking for?
Well...
He's looking for his ＠アイテム９＠.
It looks like he lost it at the harbor. {LF}The harbor's a pretty big place, so {LF}it might not be so easy to find.{LF}Ugh...this is such a tragedy.
"Such a tragedy"? Sounds like you're{LF}taking this pretty personally, Julia. {LF}I think maybe you're letting yourself{LF}get a little too caught up in it.
Heehee. Maybe. 
Well, if you do find it, could{LF}you bring it to me?
I mean, after all, he did ask me...
Bring it to you...so you can get{LF}all the credit for finding it?!
Well, yeah. {LF}What's so wrong with that?
I'm obviously going to give you{LF}something for it, so what's the big{LF}deal?
Hmm, all right. I get it.
So I should look for Byron's{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}at the harbor and then bring it to you?
You got it! Good luck, ＠カイル＠＠.
Did you find the mayor's ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}He said he dropped it {LF}somewhere at the harbor.
If you find it, make sure to bring{LF}it to me first. Thanks!|
Julia, I saw the bulletin board.{LF}There's something you wanted to{LF}talk to me about?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, I've been waiting for you! Okay, so it goes like this...
You know that I'm really into{LF}dieting and beauty and stuff, right?
Well, I was thinking it would be{LF}nice if maybe people around here{LF}put just a tiny bit more care into{LF}how they look.
But I'm thinking that maybe people{LF}around here don't know the first{LF}thing about beauty.
Sooo, I realized that maybe I should{LF}just go ahead and enlighten everyone{LF}on the subject. 
Uh huh...
So, it's a little sudden, but I{LF}figured that you could help with {LF}the first step of my{LF}"Beauty Promotion Plan"!
Mmmhmm...
Okay, ＠カイル＠＠, let's get{LF}into the tub!
What?! I don’t think I'm ready for{LF}that...
Ahaha! Oh, you thought I meant that{LF}we were going to take a bath together?
No, no, it's not like that at all.{LF}Get your mind out of the gutter!
After you get in the bath, I'm{LF}going to come and supervise you!
Uh, what exactly do you mean by{LF}"supervise me"?
Well, if you want to be beautiful,{LF}you need to take really long baths.
So you're going to challenge yourself{LF}to stay in there for a long, long{LF}time. Sound good?
Honestly, I've never really spent{LF}all that much time in the bath...
Well, I'm sure you'll find some{LF}way to manage.
This is a good chance for you to{LF}stop looking like such a farmer!
Hmm... So I guess I can't really{LF}get out of this, can I...?
Of course you can't! {LF}Okay, get ready for bathtime!
It's awfully hot in the bath.{LF}I hope I don't get overheated...
You'll be fine! You're tough, right?
Okay, now commencing{LF}"Operation: Extended Bathtime"!{LF}Good luck, ＠カイル＠＠!
Okay... I don't feel so good{LF}about this, though...
It'll be fine! I'll be here with you{LF}the whole time. If it gets to be{LF}too much, just say something.
Okay...
.........{LF}.........
This is getting kind of boring.{LF}Let's talk about something.
Hmm, okay.
Well...I picked this really big{LF}vegetable earlier... 
That topic is boring me already.{LF}Stop!
Boy, that's pretty harsh...
Um, okay, so...{LF}You always wear very interesting{LF}clothing, Julia.
What does THAT mean?!{LF}Are you trying to tell me{LF}I dress weird?!
No, no, it's not that!{LF}Your clothing's just very...different {LF}from what I see everyone else wearing.{LF}It stands out, that's all.
Ahh, well, I make it a point to{LF}always be on the cutting edge{LF}of fashion.
But why did you start dressing{LF}like that in the first place?
Well, I mean, because it's cute,{LF}and I guess I just
wanted to look a little different{LF}from everyone else.
You could say I wanted to{LF}create an image for myself.
Don't you sometimes just want{LF}to do things a little bit differently{LF}from everyone else, ＠カイル＠＠?
Maybe you don't get it.
I guess I figured that if I looked{LF}like everybody else, nobody would{LF}pay attention to me.
And then everyone would forget{LF}about me.
So I wanted to distinguish{LF}myself as much as possible.
Dieting, putting so much{LF}energy into my image... It was{LF}all so people would notice me.
I get lonely more easily than{LF}you'd think.
..........
Wait, why am I telling you{LF}all of this?!
Ugh, I'm such an idiot!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, forget everything{LF}I just said!
This conversation is over!
And from now on, don't go bringing up{LF}such personal things!
Um, actually, Julia, you just kind{LF}of started talking about it, but...
I'm surprised to hear that{LF}that's how you feel.
I think it's cute that you're a{LF}little insecure sometimes.
You're such an idiot... Just...shut up!{LF}What are you even talking about,{LF}anyway?!
Hehehe...{LF}..........
Um, Julia? Do I still have to stay{LF}in this bath?
Duhhh! Of course you do!
Well, um...I'm not really sure{LF}how much longer I can take this.
You're already at your limit?{LF}Wow, you're not as tough as{LF}I thought you were...
No, it's not that, it's just...
Just tough it out a little longer.
You haven't even been in there for{LF}half as long as I usually am.
Da da da daaaaa!|
Umph...must...be{LF}...t-tough... 
Can't...........take....{LF}..........this................{LF}...................much....{LF}.....longer... 
*THUD*
Aghhh! ＠カイル＠＠!!!{LF}Pull yourself together!!!
Oh no! I have to get him out of there{LF}quick!!!
..........................{LF}..........................
Ughhh...{LF}Huh...? Did I...?
Ah, you're awake!{LF}You scared me!
You got dizzy and passed out.{LF}I was so worried about you!
Oh, yikes...{LF}I'm sorry. It looks like I caused{LF}you a lot of worry.
But gosh, I just can't believe that{LF}you passed out after only that long.
Hahaha...
But, Julia, maybe it wasn't the{LF}best idea to just make me stay{LF}in the bath so long like that...
Hmmm... Yeah, I guess it wasn't...
Sorrrrrry.
Well, I'm okay now,{LF}so I guess it's fine, but...
Julia, maybe these laws of beauty that{LF}you're trying to promote...well, {LF}I'm not so sure anyone can {LF}actually follow them.
They seem kind of tough...
Hmm... Well, if everyone passes out,{LF}it'll be trouble for me for sure.
I suppose that's what I'll take{LF}from this experiment...
An experiment? So you just tricked{LF}me into being your guinea pig?
Tee-hee!|
You shouldn't trick people like that!
Sorrrrry!|
Mmm, but at any rate, do you{LF}actually follow such a strict plan{LF}every day?
Of course! Nothing's more important{LF}than beauty...
You say it's important...but if you{LF}destroy your body in the process,{LF}aren't you kind of missing the whole{LF}point?
I suppose so. But still, if I{LF}don't follow my strict plan,{LF}my clothes won't fit anymore.
(Boy, worrying about beauty so{LF}much is tough...)
I understand. Just...please{LF}don't overdo it.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
I hope you do...
Maybe my "Beauty Promotion Plan"{LF}was a little much...
I'll have to think about it some more.{LF}But for now, thanks for your help!
Also, ＠カイル＠＠... 
Thanks for everything today.{LF}And I'm sorry.
Julia, I saw your message on{LF}the board. Did something happen?
Well...I kind of made a little{LF}mistake... 
Okay, so, I kind of accidentally{LF}drained the bath at the wrong time...
And, coincidentally, Natalie just{LF}happened to be in there at the time.
She said I put her in danger and{LF}she got really mad at me.
Whoa...that sounds rough... {LF}You look pretty upset about{LF}it... 
I really just can't believe I{LF}was so careless...
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠ is that you?{LF}What are you two doing here?
Ah, listen to this for a minute!
So when I was in the bath today,{LF}Julia went ahead and started{LF}draining the water. Isn't that awful?!
My foot could have been sucked right{LF}into the drain! Or I could have easily{LF}slipped and fallen!
Natalie, I see where you're coming{LF}from, but look, Julia's pretty upset{LF}about all of this too...
I'm really sorry, Natalie. You were {LF}in danger because of me...
See, Natalie? I know you're upset, but{LF}Julia already feels terrible.{LF}
I understand.
Just don't do it again! I'll{LF}forgive you this time, but...
Well, I guess everyone makes{LF}mistakes. Yes, I was in danger,{LF}but maybe I overreacted a little.
I'm sorry, Julia.
Don't be. It was my fault.{LF}Natalie, I'm really sorry.
Phew, so everything's okay?
I think this conversation can end here.
Okay, well, I've got some things{LF}that I need to go do. I'll see you{LF}two around.
That turned out well. It looks{LF}like Natalie understood that you{LF}feel bad enough.
But from now on, please try and be{LF}a little more careful, Julia.
..........
.........
You didn't have to butt in like that!
I'm not totally helpless!{LF}I can fight my own battles, you{LF}know!
You're a jerk, ＠カイル＠＠!
Was it something I said?
I don't understand girls at all....
Julia, I saw the bulletin board.{LF}It looks like you need my help {LF}with something.
I do, I do. Okay, so it's like this...
Earlier, while I was still preparing{LF}the baths, Douglas came in totally{LF}drenched in sweat.
I told him that he couldn't come in{LF}yet, that I was still getting ready,{LF}but... 
He said that he couldn't afford{LF}to wait and, well, he just jumped in.
But at that point I still hadn't {LF}adjusted the water temperature {LF}so it was really, really hot.
And, well, Douglas kind of got burnt{LF}a little.
So, I want to apologize to him,{LF}but I'm kind of scared...
So I was hoping maybe you could{LF}stop by Douglas' and 
ask him what his thoughts on{LF}the whole thing are for me.
I see....{LF}But I kind of feel like this whole mess{LF}isn't really your fault, Julia...
Wasn't it pretty foolish for Douglas{LF}to just ignore you and jump into{LF}the bath?
Hmm, you're probably right, but{LF}still, I don't want people around{LF}here to think badly of me.
So I still think it's probably better{LF}if I apologize to him.
You can help me with that, right?
No problem. I'll talk to Douglas{LF}and then come back here.
Heh, thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll be waiting for you.
Go ask Douglas what he thinks{LF}for me, okay?
I'm kind of afraid, so I can't{LF}really go myself.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠, what did he{LF}say? He's mad, isn't he?
Not at all. In fact, he said{LF}that it was his fault and he{LF}apologized.
See? There was nothing for{LF}you to worry about.
Really? Wow. Thank you.
He said there was definitely no need{LF}for you to apologize. It was all his{LF}mistake.
So it looks like your bathhouse's {LF}reputation is safe.
Sure. But still, what if I had{LF}gotten mad at him or something?{LF}What would people think about me?
They would stop liking me or{LF}something, wouldn't they?
I don't think that would happen...{LF}I think it's okay for you to{LF}get mad sometimes, Julia.
Though, to be fair, you always{LF}seem kind of mad at me...
Well, ＠カイル＠＠, you're kind of{LF}a special case...
You kind of...get me...and... 
Uh, never mind. It's nothing!{LF}
I don't want to be disliked.{LF}By anyone.
But even I just want to{LF}be direct sometimes.
And that has something to do with{LF}why you only get mad at me...?
I'm really happy that you can{LF}talk to me honestly, but it's a{LF}little scary when you get really{LF}mad at me...
Don't worry about it! I really like{LF}that I can show you my feelings and{LF}you don't hate me or get frightened{LF}away.
Think of it as an honor!
Well, it is nice that you're willing{LF}to be open about your feelings with{LF}me...
And I know you don't like to feel{LF}vulnerable, so I'm glad that you're{LF}willing to be vulnerable with me... 
H-Hey! Vulnerable?! I'm not vulnerable!{LF}How could you say something like that?!
But thanks... 
That's kind of encouraging to hear.
Really, it's nothing.
Teeheehee!
Julia, I saw your message on the{LF}board. You're worried about your{LF}bathhouse?
Yeah. Could you listen to me{LF}for a little bit?
Sure. Go ahead.
Okay, well... For a while now, I've{LF}been getting less and less business.
So I'm not taking in as much money,{LF}and it's really putting me in trouble.
If things keep going like this, well, {LF}the store's going to go under.
I can't let that happen!
I'm in such trouble! What can I{LF}possibly do....?
Wow, that does sound terrible...{LF}I can't think of anything off the{LF}top of my head, either...
Ah, I've got it! If I want more{LF}customers, I should find a way to{LF}get some publicity!
Please, can you give me a hand,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? You want me to do it?!
Of course! Can't you see I{LF}desperately need some help?
Hmmm....{LF}So, what should we do?
Hmm, well, I should probably get{LF}something rare to put in my{LF}bathhouse, right?
Something rare?
Yeah, something rare.
For example, I hear that{LF}there's something called a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
It's supposed to be realllly valuable.{LF}If I had something like that, everyone{LF}would come to see it, wouldn't they?
I see... {LF}A ＠アイテム９＠?
Yup. So, ＠カイル＠＠, can you bring{LF}one back for me?
Huh?{LF}Not again...
But it would work so well!{LF}Ahh, I want one...
Rumor has it that you can{LF}find one in Messhina Valley.
But I've never even seen one!{LF}That's how rare it is!
If I get one, it'll really draw{LF}the crowds in! Do your best to find{LF}one for me, okay?
You can do it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I believe in you!
Hmmm... I'm really not so sure...{LF}If I don't get one, don't be{LF}disappointed, okay?
Of course I won't.{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
I hear you can find a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}in Messhina Valley.
But I'm sure they don't show up{LF}too often. Try your hardest to{LF}find one for me, okay?
You can do it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I believe in you!
That was really scary!{LF}Places with monsters are not places{LF}where people should go...
So let me see the ＠アイテム９＠!|
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠、{LF}you made it.
So, what do you need, Julia?
Uhh... Hmm... Boy, it sure is{LF}nice out today! Tee-hee-hee!|
Umm, and you need me to...?{LF}If you don't have anything for{LF}me to do, I'm just going to go home...
Hold on! Um, okay, ＠カイル＠＠, I{LF}was wondering if maybe you'd like{LF}to, um...
Go on a...date with me?
I mean, I don't dislike you or{LF}anything, so I figured maybe it'd{LF}be fun...
But don't get the wrong idea!{LF}It's not like THAT or anything!
I was just thinking that I wanted{LF}to...get to know a little more about{LF}you.
So I was th-thinking that we{LF}could go on a date.
Sound good? Maybe?
Hmmm... 
Sure, let's do it.{LF}Let's go on a date, Julia.
Ahhhhh....
Really?{LF}Thanks! So you're{LF}not rejecting me?
Ah, but...I kind of want to{LF}keep it a secret. The date, that is.
If everyone sees the two of us{LF}out together, they might start{LF}disliking me. I don't want that.
It'll be fine. You're your own person.{LF}Nobody's going to change their view{LF}of you or anything.
Hmm, maybe so.{LF}Anyways, shall we pick a time and place?
How does tomorrow morning, 6:00{LF}at ＠マップ９＠{LF}sound?
It's early, so I doubt anyone else{LF}will be around. I think we'll be able{LF}to get some privacy.
Got it. Tomorrow, 6:00 AM at{LF}＠マップ９＠.
Okay, it's a date!|{LF}Don't be late!
You didn't forget about our date, right?{LF}Meet me at {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 6:00 tomorrow morning!|
If you stand me up or something,{LF}I won't talk to you.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Aren't you a little late?
I've been waiting for a while!{LF}Do you not want to go out with me?
Sure I do. Sorry.
I was worried... {LF}Well, I guess I'll let{LF}it slide this time.
Hmm... 
Okay, pull yourself together!{LF}I'm starting the date.
Let's go down to the port{LF}and have a look.
Okay.
Let's go a little further down.
Sounds good.
The sea is so pretty!|
It really is, isn't it? I was really{LF}stunned the first time I saw it.
If you spend too much time in the{LF}town, you can take it for granted.{LF}It's easy to forget just how{LF}beautiful it is.
This is the first time I've looked{LF}at the sea with you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hahaha. It's really nice to watch{LF}the sea with you, Julia.
Tee-hee-hee!|
Hmmm... But still, what would{LF}people think if they saw us...?
We should probably go home{LF}before that happens...
There's no reason to be embarrassed,{LF}Julia. You should do whatever you{LF}want to.
Well, I don't know about that...
I think about what would happen{LF}if someone didn't like me and...{LF}I get scared.
Julia...
You can't always just be worried{LF}about what everyone else is going{LF}to think about you. You need to be{LF}more true to yourself.
This Julia, the one that I get to{LF}talk with, is so charming.
I like that she talks about what's{LF}really on her mind.
＠カイル＠＠... 
Sure, sometimes she can be a{LF}little mean, but...
Hehe, you idiot... 
Hahaha... 
But if that's the real you, then it's{LF}great. I don't think anybody could{LF}actually dislike you.
Because honestly, I don't dislike{LF}you at all...
So I think that you should let{LF}other people see this side of you{LF}a little bit too.
Have a little more confidence in{LF}yourself, Julia. Because nobody's{LF}going to stop liking you just{LF}for being who you are.
＠カイル＠＠...{LF}Thank you... 
You're right. I spend too much time{LF}worrying about what other{LF}people think. 
It's just that the thought of other{LF}people not liking me is{LF}so scary, I can't stand it.
But without even realizing it, I've{LF}started ignoring my real self.
Even though I want people to like me,{LF}I haven't been showing them what I'm{LF}really like... {LF}I'm lying to all of them.
I realize when I talk to you that I{LF}can't keep going on like this.
But still...I'm scared.
It'll be fine, Julia. Please, believe{LF}me when I say this...
If you're honest with everyone about{LF}how you feel, they'll probably find you{LF}even more likeable than they do now.
That's the kind of Julia I want to see.{LF}One who becomes popular by being{LF}herself.
I wonder if that's possible.
It is. I know you can do it, Julia!
Okay... 
Plus, maybe that way you'd get mad{LF}at some other people for a change.
H-Hey!
Heh. I was just joking.
Enough already.{LF}You're such an idiot, ＠カイル＠＠.
Thanks...
Of course.
So, shall we head home?
We probably should.
＠カイル＠＠...
I...like you.
Huh?
Really...thanks for today.
Here's something...from me.
*mwah*
!!!!!
Bye bye! Tee-hee-hee!|
Ah, it looks like your backpack{LF}is full. Lighten it up a bit.
Isn't springtime just wonderful? {LF}It gets warm and you just want to go{LF}outside and do things!
It really is. I like how{LF}warm it gets too.
I knew it! I always thought you{LF}looked like someone who liked the{LF}spring.
Everything just feels kind{LF}of tranquil, doesn't it?
Hmm, yeah...
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival!{LF}Everyone's getting really excited.{LF}I'm getting excited too, of course.
There's a banquet in the afternoon,{LF}right? It should be a pretty wild{LF}party...
Honestly, it seems like everyone cares{LF}more about the food than the flowers.
The earthquake was quite a surprise,{LF}wasn't it? I'm okay, though.
I'm relieved to know you didn't get{LF}hurt or anything.
Hmm? You were worried about me?{LF}It looks like everyone else is okay{LF}too, so I think everything's fine {LF}for now.
The Eating Contest is tomorrow.
Speed-eating isn't very good for your{LF}body, so I think I'm going to have to {LF}pass on this one.
Hahaha. Yeah, it's not the best{LF}thing for your health, I guess.
It really looks like a lot of fun,{LF}though!
Ah yes, tomorrow's the start of{LF}swimming season, isn't it?
Swimming in the ocean can be{LF}fun, but you have to make sure{LF}to put lotion on your skin!
That sounds like a lot of work{LF}just to go in the ocean.
Well, it's hard work being a girl.
Tomorrow's the Monster Taming{LF}Contest.
Aren't all monsters kind of scary,{LF}though? I don't really like the {LF}thought of taming one. They're{LF}all pretty savage.{LF}
Monsters are definitely dangerous{LF}by nature, so you have to be careful.
If you participate, ＠カイル＠＠, I{LF}think it's probably better if you go{LF}with a monster that's not too{LF}dangerous.
There was another earthquake.{LF}They...They really scare me.
They're frightening, for sure.
If anything bad were to ever happen{LF}to me, ＠カイル＠＠, you'd save me,{LF}right?
Ugh, sooo hot. Something seriously{LF}needs to be done about this heat.{LF}Will you fan me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? You want me to fan you?
Yeah, well, I mean{LF}it's really hot out.
Got it. Is this good?
Ahhhhh, that feels so good!{LF}You can't stop until I cool down.
Uh, I kind of have something to do,{LF}so I, um, gotta run!
Tomorrow's the Dance Festival.{LF}Wow, I can't believe I'm already{LF}getting nervous.
Uh, are you going to ask anyone to go{LF}with you, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Never mind! I'll find out tomorrow.{LF}Forget I asked.
Umm...okay.
Hee-hee! I can't wait for{LF}tomorrow!|
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest!{LF}Fish is such a healthy food.
How about you try{LF}participating, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You can catch a lot of fish and{LF}then give some to me!|
I would really like to give you {LF}some, Julia, but I'm not too{LF}confident about my fishing skills.
Ah, I don't like seeing this side{LF}of you, ＠カイル＠＠. Give it a shot. {LF}You've got nothing to lose, right?
Tomorrow's the Adventure Contest.{LF}A weak girl like me has no place{LF}participating in something like that.
But you can count on me to cheer{LF}you on!
I must say, I'm pretty excited for{LF}the Adventure Contest.
I'll be cheering for you while{LF}I'm relaxing in the bath.
Doesn't really sound like you'll{LF}be cheering me on at all...
Can you believe there was{LF}another earthquake? I can't{LF}deal with them anymore.
Was everything okay? My house was{LF}fine, but...
Yeah, I'm fine too. Still, doesn't it{LF}seem like there have been a lot{LF}of earthquakes these days? I wonder{LF}if something's going on.
It's the Harvest Festival tomorrow.{LF}Of course, I give thanks for the{LF}earth's bounty every day.
Really? I'm actually a little surprised{LF}to hear you say that, Julia.
Well, maybe I did exaggerate a{LF}little bit. Heh heh.
Heh...
Wow, it's really fall, isn't it?{LF}The evenings have gotten nice{LF}and cool.
They really have. But you have{LF}to make sure and bundle up once{LF}it starts getting really cold.
Yeah, I know. But it feels really nice{LF}to take a long, hot bath when the{LF}weather gets cooler.
The Monster Contest is tomorrow.{LF}Aren't all monsters vicious and scary?
No no, even though they're monsters,{LF}if you treat them nicely, they can {LF}become quite good pets.
Wow, really?{LF}I guess there's a lot about{LF}monsters that I don't know.
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}If you wish upon a shooting star,{LF}it'll come true.
Isn't that romantic?
Wow, really? It seems like{LF}you really like this holiday, Julia.
Ah, you so get me, ＠カイル＠＠.
Ahhhh, my heart's pounding.
It's been cold lately, hasn't it?{LF}Has it been hard for you to get{LF}out of bed in the morning?
No, it's been fine for me.{LF}What about you, Julia?
Oh, I can barely make it.{LF}I don't even want to take one{LF}step away from my bed anymore.
But I do like getting into the{LF}bath on cold days.
The Mining Contest is tomorrow.{LF}You don't really strike me as the type{LF}that would use hammers and stuff,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Really?{LF}I mean, I use them pretty often...
I just always imagine them being{LF}better for people like Douglas and{LF}Gordon.
Seems like those sorts of things{LF}suit the two of them a little TOO{LF}well, doesn't it...?
Ugh, that earthquake{LF}ruined my life...
Wh-What happened?!{LF}Are you okay?!{LF}Are you hurt or anything?!
I'm fine...{LF}But I spilled my tea and it stained{LF}this outfit that I really like...
Huh? Ahh... Please don't make it{LF}sound so serious next time!
I was worried that you had been{LF}seriously injured or something.
Well it was a serious {LF}injury to me!
Ugh and I liked it so much...{LF}You don't really understand{LF}girls, do you, ＠カイル＠＠.
The year ends tomorrow.{LF}Wow, a lot happened{LF}this year, didn't it?
It was a busy year for sure.{LF}Is there anything left that you{LF}want to do this year?{LF}If so, you'd better hurry up...
Nope, nothing in particular.{LF}Besides, it's not like I can complete{LF}my resolution in a single year.{LF}I need to work hard next year too.
Ahaha, that sounds like you, Julia.
It's gotten hot out, hasn't it?{LF}Ah, it just makes me feel so lazy.
When the sun gets strong, you have{LF}to make sure to take good care {LF}of your skin!
There's so many yummy things to eat{LF}in the fall. It can be so hard... If{LF}you let yourself get seduced by all the{LF}food, you start getting fat, and...
It's cold outside, isn't it?{LF}Ah, but I guess kids don't{LF}really care about things like{LF}that.
How are you liking Alvarna?
It feels nice now that everything{LF}has settled down.
Ah, so you like it? Great!{LF}I hope you get used to{LF}life around here quickly!
How are you liking Alvarna?
It's a nice place.
It is! Especially my bathhouse!{LF}Tee-hee!|
How are you liking Alvarna?
It feels nice now that everything{LF}has settled down.
Ah, that's good.
But doesn't it get kind of{LF}lonely in the evenings?
Breakfast is the most important{LF}meal of the day! Have you been{LF}eating yours? I always make sure{LF}to eat a nice big breakfast.
You can eat a lot for breakfast{LF}and still not get fat.
Did you eat lunch already? Because{LF}judging from the way you've been{LF}walking, it looks like you forgot.
I try not to eat too much for dinner.
It makes you fat. Dinner is dieting's{LF}natural enemy.
I like ＠アイテム９＠!{LF}It's so nutritious and{LF}healthy!|
I like ＠アイテム９＠!{LF}It's so nutritious and{LF}healthy!|

Looks like you've been{LF}making some friends.
I'm really close with everyone{LF}in this town.
So if you want to make friends,{LF}you should try learning from me!
Looks like you've been steadily{LF}making some friends.
I'm really close with everyone{LF}in this town.
So if you want to make friends,{LF}you should try learning from me!
I'm Julia, friend to all!|
Looks like you've been steadily{LF}making some friends.
Me, I get along well with{LF}Dorothy and Rosalind.
The thing with Dorothy is that{LF}if you try talking to her, she's{LF}actually surprisingly interesting.
This country is called the Kingdom{LF}of Norad. It's said that the human{LF}race was born here.
That's an old legend.
It's a country with a{LF}long history, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Norad's not a big country, though, {LF}and it never gets tied up in wars.{LF}It's a nice place.
Yes, peace is a wonderful thing.
Well, there's really not all that{LF}much here, so it's kind of a little{LF}TOO peaceful, but oh well...
Norad is such a peaceful{LF}place, isn't it? Kind of makes{LF}you wonder if wars are really{LF}happening in other places...
Isn't that a good thing?{LF}Peace is what's most important.
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, you{LF}get to take baths whenever you{LF}want...
What happened, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You're looking a little brighter {LF}than usual.
Really? There's nothing in{LF}particular, but...
Really? Guess you're just {LF}always in good spirits, huh?
Did something good happen to you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠? You're looking a little bit{LF}brighter than usual.
Really?{LF}No, nothing in particular.
Well something nice happened to me.{LF}These cute clothes that I ordered{LF}a little while back are finally ready.
Ooh, I want to see them. Do you{LF}have all of your clothes custom made?
Really? Okay! Yup, as you can{LF}imagine, if you really want to be on{LF}the cutting edge of fashion, you have{LF}to have your clothes custom made!
If you stop by my place, I'll{LF}show them to you!
Did something good happen{LF}to you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Hm? Does it look like that?{LF}No, there's nothing in particular.
Well something nice happened to me.{LF}I got this brand-new bath oil that's{LF}supposed to be really good for beauty.
Hahaha, that's good. When it comes{LF}to beauty, you'll do anything, {LF}won't you?
Yup, nothing comes before beauty!{LF}It smells really nice. Do you want to{LF}try using it too?
I think I'll refrain. I mean, I am a boy.
If I don't make myself pretty,{LF}I won't be popular,..
So I've been collecting ＠アイテム８＠.
I really like things that smell nice.
So I've been collecting ＠アイテム８＠.
I really like things that smell nice.
So I've been collecting ＠アイテム８＠.
I really like things that smell nice.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you have{LF}any interest in fashion?
Fashion? No, not really...
I see. I pay reallllly careful{LF}attention to fashion.
Even these clothes I'm wearing{LF}are custom made.
That's really cool. {LF}Well, you're just naturally chic, Julia.
Teehee, thanks. It makes me really{LF}happy when people compliment my style.
I have tons of other fancy outfits,{LF}more than I can count.
Do you have any interest in{LF}fashion, ＠カイル＠＠?
Ummm...not really.
Hahah, I kind of got that sense{LF}from you. That's a little unusual{LF}for a girl, though.
Even these clothes I'm wearing{LF}are custom made.
That's really cool.{LF}Well, you're just naturally chic, Julia.
Teehee, thanks. It makes me really{LF}happy when people compliment {LF}my style.
Aside from fashion, I'll do anything{LF}that will help me look beautiful.
I've been so desperate sometimes{LF}that I've tried crazy things, like the{LF}handstand diet...
That sounds a bit strange...
＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}of my fashion sense?
What?!{LF}Uh, I don't know what to say.
He-he-he, what's wrong?{LF}Actually, my clothes are{LF}custom made...
Really? That's really cool.{LF}You're pretty stylish, Julia.
Oh, thanks.{LF}I love it when I get {LF}compliments!
＠カイル＠＠, I've never seen clothes{LF}like yours around here.{LF}It kind of caught my eye.
Have your heard anything about me{LF}from anyone else, ＠カイル＠＠?
What?!　No, not really, but{LF}why do you ask?
Oh, it's not important. I just don't {LF}want you to get a bad impression{LF}from some crazy rumor you might hear...
Roy is always spreading{LF}crazy rumors, so you know...
What a trouble maker...
The other day, I told Roy and Cammy{LF}"If you don't take a bath every day{LF}
a ghost will get you," and I guess they{LF}believed me, so now 
they come everyday saying, {LF}"Got to get a bath again today!"{LF}
But I guess it's good for business,{LF}and it keeps them clean, so I {LF}suppose there's no harm, right?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}are you the type to gossip?
Not really. Why do you ask?
I was wondering if you could spread{LF}the word that my bath has miraculous{LF}water that can cure any illness.
If you did, business would{LF}really pick up, wouldn't it?
Ha-ha...even if I did, everyone{LF}would figure out it's not true.{LF}What's the point?
I guess it's not the best plan...
Actually, I'm really afraid of{LF}＠アイテム７＠S. {LF}I can't stand them...
Don't ever bring me one.
Actually, I'm really afraid of{LF}＠アイテム７＠S. {LF}I can't stand them...
Don't ever bring me one.
Actually, I'm really afraid of{LF}＠アイテム７＠S. {LF}I can't stand them...
Don't ever bring me one.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}Do you know when my birthday is?
Sorry, I don't know...
Oh, didn't I tell you?{LF}It's on the 16th of Spring!{LF}Don't forget!|
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}My birthday is{LF}on the 16th of Spring!
What?!　It is?{LF}What made you tell me that{LF}out of the blue?
Well, just so you know...{LF}Now I can't wait for my birthday!
Oh, I get it....
What do think of birthdays,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
What?! Um, I guess it's supposed{LF}to be a special day, right?
That's right.{LF}And since it's special, you must{LF}celebrate it properly.
The 16th of Spring is{LF}my birthday!| I hope {LF}I get a big celebration!
I've been wanting to ask you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠, how do you feel about me?
Uh...well, um... 
Oh, it's not important.
Oh, did I surprise you?{LF}Never mind...
Oh, come on. You jerk.
I was just wondering, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}How do you feel about me?
Uh...well, um... 
Oh, it's not important.
Are you blushing?{LF}Hee-hee, never mind...
Okay, I get it... 
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}So, exactly what am I{LF}to you?
Uh...well, um... 
Oh, it's not important.
I love you.
Ha-ha! What kind of reaction is that?
Oh, come on. I see.
Huh? No way! Hold on!{LF}This is no place{LF}to profess your love!!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, you're such an idiot!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}Are you enjoying farming?
Well, yeah, it's okay...
When you get all sweaty, you mustn't{LF}forget to take a bath.
You'd better not come near me when{LF}you're filthy and dirty!
What are you growing now, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, right now...
Oh, it doesn't matter.{LF}Just make sure it's something delicious!
＠カイル＠＠, do you work late{LF}in the fields?
Well, sometimes I do.
Oh, I see.{LF}Be sure to get enough rest, or{LF}your skin will get all dry and crackly.
If that happens,{LF}I won't even talk to you.
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}sometimes I use the same bath water
again without changing it...
What?! That's terrible...
Very rarely, though!{LF}It's not like I do it all the time!{LF}And, anyway, it doesn't get that dirty, {LF}so it should be okay...I think... 
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}lately, I've actually...umm...
What? Is it a secret?
I've been taking longer baths lately.{LF}For an hour or two.
Ha-ha! That's nothing to hide.{LF}Just don't stay in so long that {LF}you pass out.
It's all for beauty, you know.{LF}I just can't skimp on that.
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}lately, I've actually...umm...
Yes, what is it?
I've changed my make-up!{LF}Do I look prettier than before?
Oh, yeah, yes!{LF}I think you look even more beautiful.{LF}(I wonder what she changed...)
Really?{LF}Okay, see if you can guess{LF}what I changed!
What?!{LF}Um... 
Is it your eyes?
What?
That's right!{LF}You've been really paying attention!|
(Whew! That was a lucky guess...)
I just can't stand filthy people.{LF}I just want to tell them to take{LF}a bath!
I just can't stand filthy people.{LF}I just want to tell them to take{LF}a bath!
I just can't stand filthy people.{LF}I just want to tell them to take{LF}a bath!
＠カイル＠＠, what {LF}do you plan to do in the future?
Well, I've never really given it{LF}much thought.
I want to run my{LF}bathhouse forever!
This job is probably the best one{LF}for me.
＠カイル＠＠, what {LF}do you plan to do in the future?
Well, I've never really given it{LF}much thought.
I want to continue to run my{LF}bathhouse.
I can enjoy a luxurious hot bath{LF}anytime I like, so I can't imagine{LF}ever quitting.
＠カイル＠＠, what {LF}do you plan to do in the future?
Well, I've never really given it{LF}much thought.
I want to run my bathhouse forever!
If I give it up, I'll have to go back{LF}to a normal, tiny bathtub. And that's{LF}not going to happen!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}do you think I've changed{LF}lately?
No, not really.
Have you gained a little weight, maybe?
Really?　That's okay, then!
Wow!{LF}Can you really tell?
Hmm, maybe you've been{LF}eating a little too much lately...
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}don't you think I've changed{LF}lately?
No, not really.
Have you gained a little weight, maybe?
Really?{LF}Maybe I'm making too much of it...{LF}Oh, it's nothing.{LF}Never mind!
Wow, then you really{LF}can see a difference!
But even if you think so, {LF}you should never tell a girl{LF}that she's gained weight!
You have noticed, haven't you!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, you're such an idiot!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}Do I seem different{LF}to you lately?
No, not really.
Well, something seems different...
Have you gained weight?
A-ha! Whew! I guess I don't{LF}need to worry about it!
Good, it seems like{LF}it's not so bad yet.{LF}I've just been slacking off on{LF}my diet a lot lately...
Wow, you really have a {LF}sharp eye!
But you don't have to come right out{LF}and say I've gained weight!
＠カイル＠＠, you're such an idiot!
Hey, look at this.{LF}At breakfast this morning,{LF}I spilled coffee on{LF}my outfit!
Oh no...I hope this stain will come out.
Oh, this is terrible!{LF}You'd better wash it right away!
Yeah, I guess so. Better wash it.{LF}Ugh, I don't feel like{LF}doing anything today...
Cover for me, okay?
Come on, hang in there!
Ahh, the boiler for the bathtub has{LF}been acting up all morning{LF}and I don't know what to do!
That's really a problem.{LF}Did you get it to work?
No, it's not fixed yet, but{LF}it's so much trouble, {LF}I'm just putting it off.{LF}I'll do it later!
There was something wrong with {LF}the boiler for the bath, but...
But what?
It was just plugged up with soot.{LF}I guess I should keep it clean.
I really haven't been{LF}doing a very good job.
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}have you ever thought{LF}about marriage?
Not yet.
I have.
Oh, you haven't? You don't even{LF}have your eye on anyone yet?
Oh?　Does that mean{LF}you have someone in mind?
Once you're married, there are all{LF}sorts of problems that come up,{LF}aren't there...?
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}have you ever thought{LF}about marriage?
Not yet.
I have.
I guess so.
Really?{LF}Do you have someone{LF}you'd like to marry?
Married life should be{LF}something you enjoy!|
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}have you ever thought{LF}about marriage?
Not yet.
I have.
Oh. You haven't thought about it at{LF}all, then?
What? Do you already know{LF}who you want to marry?{LF}Could it possibly be...{LF}maybe, me, or something?
After all, marriage is{LF}one of the biggest events{LF}in your life, you know!
＠カイル＠＠, have you ever{LF}thought about doing something{LF}besides farming?
No, I've never really thought about it.
Really? When I get sick of cleaning{LF}the baths, I always think about getting{LF}a different job.
Ha-ha-ha{LF}I think any job has its tough parts.
Well, that's probably true, but...{LF}sometimes I'm tempted to see if{LF}there's something easier.
＠カイル＠＠, how about {LF}running the bathhouse with me?
Huh?　What are you talking about?
Oh, I was just thinking that if you{LF}run the bath house with me, I wouldn't{LF}have to do all this cleaning!
So you just want to get out of{LF}doing the cleaning...
Lately, my clothes feel a {LF}little bit tight.{LF}I wonder if I've gained weight.
I'm so embarrassed by the way I look,{LF}I can't go see anyone like this.
Really?{LF}I don't think you look any different.
＠カイル＠＠, you might not notice,{LF}but I can tell the difference.
Do you know about {LF}the "Forest of Beginnings"?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
I don't know much about it, but{LF}they say that monsters live there.{LF}I never want to go near there!
Hmm.{LF}I'm glad you know about it.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know what{LF}the "Forest of Beginnings" is?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
I don't know much about it, but{LF}I've heard that lots of monsters{LF}live there.
I never want to go to{LF}a place like that!
So, you know about it.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}Do you know about {LF}the "Forest of Beginnings"?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
According to rumors,{LF}I've heard that lots of monsters{LF}live there.
I don't mind as long as the monsters{LF}stay there!
Really? You already know about it?
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything{LF}about the village you don't like?
Let's see... Nothing, really.
I wish people would{LF}pay a little more attention{LF}to their appearance!
Not that there's much they can do{LF}about it here, anyway.
We need a spa, hair salon,{LF}some nice clothing shops...
When I start thinking about it, {LF}there's just no end!
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything{LF}about the village you don't like?
Let's see...{LF}I can't really think of anything.
I sometimes wish there were more{LF}people living here. Then my bathhouse{LF}would make more money.
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything{LF}about the village you don't like?
No, not really.
Is there anything you don't like?
Wow, ＠カイル＠＠, you have{LF}fewer desires than I thought!
I guess so.{LF}I wish there were more{LF}beauty places like spas{LF}and hair salons.
It's really hard to preserve your{LF}beauty in this village!
Hey, don't you think the power of{LF}the earth is amazing?
Uh, sure. But what brought this on{LF}all of a sudden?
I was just thinking about hot springs!{LF}How water that's available 24{LF}hours a day!
No time needed to heat the water!{LF}It's incredible!
Ha-ha-ha. I always think about the{LF}power of the earth when I see my{LF}crops growing.
＠カイル＠＠, you're always thinking{LF}about farming, aren't you?
Yes. It's my job, after all.
＠カイル＠＠, you really are one with{LF}the land, aren't you?
It's fine to be a little wild, but{LF}don't become as wild as Douglas{LF}and Gordon!
I'd never be able to keep up with you!
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}Those two are crazy...
I appreciate your hard work{LF}in the fields each day!
Ha ha! Thank you.{LF}You're working hard every day at {LF}the bath house, too, Julia.
Am I really working hard, or{LF}just opening up shop... ?
Especially when it rains. It doesn't{LF}feel like I'm working then. There{LF}are barely any customers!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}have you ever heard of{LF}the Elder Dragon?
It's a powerful, ancient creature, but{LF}I don't really know much else about it.
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}ever heard of the Elder Dragons?
They're legendary dragons, but{LF}I'm not very interested in{LF}folktales and that sort of thing.
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}ever heard of the Elder Dragon?
I hear it destroys villages.{LF}I wish it would stop!
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes, what is it, Julia?
I'm glad I met you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Things have gotten more interesting{LF}with you here. Thanks!
Same here.{LF}Thank you, Julia.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Here's to more fun times!
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes, what is it, Julia?
＠カイル＠＠, you're{LF}nice to everyone, aren't you?{LF}I really love that about you.
Uh...well....{LF}Uh, thank you!
You're something else, too, Julia.{LF}You're always trying to help{LF}everyone.
Hee-hee. I'm glad you think so,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'm really happy to have{LF}a friend like you!
＠カイル＠＠, you're{LF}nice to everyone, aren't you?{LF}I really love that about you.
Uh...well....{LF}Uh, thank you!
You're something else, too, Julia.{LF}You're always trying to help{LF}everyone.
So, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}here's to our friendship!
You're a lively thing, just like {LF}your daddy! But don't get too crazy.
Don't go near any monsters!{LF}They're dangerous!
I'm afraid of monsters, so{LF}I won't go near them.
Are you getting all your homework{LF}done for school?
If you want, I can help you!|
＠アルス＠＠, are you being{LF}nice to your friends?
You're not getting into fights are you?
Every time I look at you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I remember your father.{LF}You look so much like him.
I haven't had time to run the shop{LF}since I got married.
But Cammy offered to help out{LF}and take care of the shop!{LF}
So she's really been a life saver!|
It's seems like those
days of greeting customers{LF}are long gone!
It looks like Cammy is doing a great{LF}job running the shop!|
Today, I want to take a nice, long bath!
Our bathhouse is really huge!{LF}I'm so proud of it!
You get really sweaty{LF}on a hot day, right?{LF}Well, our bath will make you feel{LF}fresh!|
It's gotten cooler, and your baths{LF}have gotten longer, haven't they?
What? It could be, I suppose.
Nothing beats a long, hot bath on{LF}a cold day.
Take a dip in our bath, and say{LF}goodbye to the cold!|
It's always nice and busy{LF}here, isn't it?
It's always nice and busy{LF}here, isn't it?
It's always nice and busy{LF}here, isn't it?
It's always nice and busy{LF}here, isn't it?
It feels really nice outside...{LF}So, what should we do?
When you go outside,{LF}be sure to put plenty of {LF}sunscreen on to protect your skin!
I make sure not to miss any spots when{LF}I'm applying sunscreen!
Maybe we should start using a little{LF}less sunscreen now.
It's cold isn't it...
The truth is, I've got a couple{LF}extra layers of clothing on.
Hee hee hee!
The sea breeze feels good, but{LF}if you don't take care of your hair,{LF}you'll regret it later!
It's so bright!|
The sun is so bright,{LF}I can't even open my eyes!
The harbor feels a little chilly{LF}now that it's autumn.
Don't slip and fall in the water!{LF}Be careful!
Everything feels so oddly{LF}peaceful when you're{LF}in the church.
Don't you think so, ＠アルス＠＠?
Everything feels so oddly{LF}peaceful when you're{LF}in the church.
I can see where Dorothy gets{LF}her quiet personality.
Oh, but Cammy is really noisy... {LF}so I guess the church has {LF}nothing to do with it.{LF}
The church is always a quiet{LF}kind of place, but
when Cammy and Roy show up,{LF}they always ruin the atmosphere.
＠アルス＠＠, you must remember to be{LF}quiet when you're at church.
See that piano by the side of the altar?{LF}Dorothy comes and plays for everyone{LF}sometimes. She's really good.
Even if you're not really paying{LF}attention, the music just draws you in.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, you should ask her {LF}to play!
Dorothy, your room is really{LF}a cozy place.
I never expected to meet you here!{LF}Is it something urgent?
Dorothy, your room is really{LF}a cozy place.
I never expected to meet you here!{LF}Is it something urgent?
When spring comes,{LF}there are so many things{LF}that I want to do!
It's so hot outside that{LF}I don't really want to go out much.
There's so much good food{LF}to eat in autumn that you have to be{LF}careful not to gain weight!
It cold outside, but{LF}indoors it's nice and warm!
What are you up to today, ＠アルス＠＠?
Don't go anywhere that's{LF}too dangerous, okay?
What are you up to today, ＠アルス＠＠?
It's really sunny out today, so{LF}be careful not to overexert yourself.
What are you up to today, ＠アルス＠＠?
It's starting to get chilly out, so{LF}be careful not to catch a cold.
What are you up to today, ＠アルス＠＠?
Children can keep playing{LF}no matter how cold it is outside!{LF}I don't know how they do it!
When you get tired,{LF}come home and take a break!|{LF}Don't overdo it and get sick!
This house is so big, I've got{LF}plenty of housework to keep me busy!{LF}See you later, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Have a good day!|
＠アルス＠＠, I need to{LF}teach you the ABC's{LF}of beauty care!
Come home when{LF}it gets dark!
What's this?{LF}You're getting strong, aren't you?
You two aren't doing anything{LF}secretly now, are you?
＠アルス＠＠, you're starting to{LF}remind me more of your father.
I guess it's from working in the field.{LF}You've really become handsome.
Did you do something?{LF}You look really nice.
Father has come home!
You're alive!{LF}＠カイル＠＠... 
I can't believe ＠カイル＠＠'s back!{LF}Isn't this wonderful, ＠アルス＠＠?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}what are you doing?
What are you going to do today,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Going to take a bath?{LF}That costs 100G.{LF}Okay?
Okay.
No, I changed my mind.
Sorry, we're not open right now!|
Okay, thank you{LF}for your business!|{LF}Please enjoy your bath!|
Oh, did you change your mind?{LF}Come back when you feel like a bath!|
You've had a bath already today.{LF}Only one bath per day!
Uh-oh, not enough money?{LF}I guess you can't have a bath, then.
There are men's and ladies' baths, so{LF}be careful you don't get them mixed up!|
This, this is{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, why do you{LF}have this?
Alicia gave it to me.{LF}She told me to give it to you, Natalie.{LF}She sent her apology.
She could have brought it to me{LF}herself... I can't believe that child!
Sorry you had to get mixed up {LF}in our little family spat, ＠カイル＠＠.
No problem.{LF}I can tell that you and Alicia are{LF}close, even though you fight a lot.
Of course!{LF}But eating my ＠アイテム９＠...{LF}that's unforgivable!
Ha ha ha!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll bet you'll make a great{LF}husband some day!
Huh? I haven't even thought{LF}about marriage yet.
Ha! Marriage always finds the people{LF}who expect it the least! Ah ha ha!
I wonder...{LF}I'll ask her when she gets home.
Hee-hee-hee!{LF}Newlyweds are so passionate!
Tell Alicia that I{LF}forgive her, okay?{LF}And...tell Ray thank you.
Oh, for me? Thank you!
Oh, you found it!{LF}I'm so glad!{LF}You're a real life saver!
I really didn't know what I'd do!{LF}Thank you!{LF}Here, a token of my appreciation.
You got ＠数字９＠G.{LF}
Oh, I almost forgot.{LF}Here's one more thing as thanks.
You got an ＠アイテム８＠.{LF}
What is this?
It's a bottle for holding medicine.{LF}It will come in handy when{LF}you're fighting monsters.
Thank you very much.{LF}Oh...where can I buy{LF}some medicine?
Right here, of course.
Oh yeah! Guess I should have known!{LF}Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, your backpack is full.{LF}Well, I guess I can't give you this.
Oh, for me?{LF}Thank you!
Oh, what's this?
It looks like some important papers{LF}from the capital. Byron asked me to{LF}give them to you.
Oh!　The papers!{LF}I've been waiting so long for these!{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, you're welcome.{LF}They seem to be very important.
That's right. They are. These contain{LF}the very latest information{LF}about medicine!
Medicine is so advanced in the capital!{LF}It's just unbelievable, some of the {LF}things they can do!
I need the most up-to-date information{LF}if I'm going to be the best doctor I{LF}can be.
These documents are very important,{LF}though, so they can only send them{LF}to the mayor of a town.
You're sure passionate about your work.
Illnesses and injuries never stop!{LF}I have to be fully prepared{LF}for anything that might happen.{LF}I'm just doing what's necessary.
Well, tell Byron hello{LF}for me, okay?{LF}Thanks for your help, ＠カイル＠＠.
No problem.
Oh, for me? Thank you!
Thank you very much! I love this!
Sorry, but there's no way{LF}I'll ever like this.
Thanks! I'm thrilled!{LF}I love this!
Sorry, but there's no way{LF}I'll ever like this.
Oh, this color looks like{LF}it should work.{LF}I'll take it.
It's delicious.{LF}They say good medicine tastes bitter,{LF}but this tastes wonderful.
Oh, this color looks like{LF}it should work.{LF}I'll take it.
It's delicious.{LF}They say good medicine tastes bitter,{LF}but this tastes wonderful.
I love this, but...{LF}I would have liked it on my birthday.
I love this, but...{LF}I would have liked it on my birthday.
Thanks!{LF}Today's my birthday!{LF}I'm so happy to get a{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks!{LF}Today's my birthday!{LF}I'm so happy to get a{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
It's sweet of you, but I don't think{LF}I should get so many birthday presents.
It's sweet of you, but I don't think{LF}I should get so many birthday presents.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Hmm, I can't say I'm very happy{LF}about getting this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Hmm, I can't say I'm very happy{LF}about getting this.
What can I do for you today?
I just wanted to talk.
I'm not feeling very well.
I wanted to see what you have in stock.
I wanted a ＠アイテム２＠...
It's spring, so be prepared,{LF}or you might catch a cold.
It may seem like you can't catch a{LF}cold in the summer, but don't believe{LF}it! Illness can strike in any season!
Be careful not to eat too much {LF}in autumn.
In winter, you should keep warm{LF}and go to bed early.
Here, let me take a look...{LF}Take a deep breath...{LF}Good, now let it out...
Hmm.{LF}It looks like you've been poisoned.
You're losing HP each hour.{LF}You're really in danger.
Hmm.{LF}It looks like you're paralyzed.
You won't be able to run.{LF}It will some take time before {LF}you can move around.
Hmm.{LF}Sealed, huh? This looks bad.
You won't be able to use{LF}magic or rune abilities.
Hmm.{LF}You look really worn out.
If you stay up until 3, then{LF}your going to get fatigued. You'll{LF}use up twice as many rune points.{LF}That is not a good situation.
Hmm.{LF}You're definitely sick.
Listen.{LF}If you stay up until 3, then{LF}you're going to get fatigued.
When you're already fatigued and{LF}you stay up until 3, then{LF}you're going to become ill.
When you become ill,{LF}you use up three times as many{LF}rune points.{LF}It's way too dangerous.
Okay, I understand your symptoms.{LF}You're fine. You'll get better soon.
Okay. That's all.{LF}Take it easy for a while, okay?
Your condition is displayed with the{LF}small icons under the HP/RP bar in the{LF}upper left of the bottom screen.
Touch each one to see{LF}what your condition is.
Thank you very much.
My fee is 100 G.
Okay. Thank you.{LF}It's good to work hard, but{LF}don't overdo it, okay?
Don't worry! You're the perfect{LF}picture of health! Now go out{LF}there and get some exercise!
Oh, it looks like you're short on money.
I'm sorry.
Oh well.{LF}I'll make it free this time...
Thank you very much.
You need ＠数字０＠ ＠アイテム０＠S,{LF}＠数字１＠ ＠アイテム１＠, and ＠数字２＠G.
Have you got everything?{LF}Okay, then. Just a minute.
Okay. It's ready.
You got: ＠アイテム２＠!
Oh, sorry. You don't have enough{LF}money.
Oh, sorry. You don't have enough{LF}medicinal herbs.
Oh, sorry. You don't have any{LF}empty bottles.
＠カイル＠＠, did you find Roy?
Yes. I talked him into{LF}coming here.
I'm here, Dr. Natalie.
I'm glad you came. That's very{LF}brave of you, Roy.
I promised ＠カイル＠＠{LF}I'd be brave, so...{LF}hurry and give me the shot.
Okay, here we go!
Make it quick!
Okay, all done.
What?　Already?{LF}Wow, that didn't hurt at all!
You're a good sport, Roy.
Yep!
Now you can go on and go{LF}play.
Okay. Bye!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're a big help.{LF}Here's something to show my thanks.
Thank you very much.
You got ＠数字９＠G!{LF}
I'll let you know if{LF}I need something again.{LF}Thank you.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I was waiting for you.
What do you need today?
I need to prepare some medicine, so{LF}I need some wild herbs.
You want me to go collect them?{LF}But the posting said...
It's an herb that's hard to spot, so{LF}it'd be too difficult for you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll go and get it, but could you watch{LF}over the clinic while I'm gone?
Ray and Dorothy are also here, but I'd{LF}feel better if I knew you were keeping{LF}an eye on things.
(I don't think I'm any more responsible{LF}than Ray, but if it makes Natalie{LF}feel better...)
Will you watch over the place for me?
Well, okay, but...{LF}What should I do if a patient comes?
I won't be long, so you shouldn't{LF}have to worry, but if a patient comes,{LF}just tell them to wait.
She's gone...{LF}I wish she had at least told me where{LF}she was going...
Anyway, what am I going to do if{LF}someone with an emergency comes?
Oh, Dorothy is here, so{LF}maybe it'll be okay.
No...no way!{LF}I'm just an apprentice nurse.{LF}A nurse can't do a medical {LF}examination, anyway!
Really?
Yes... So, um, if something happens...{LF}
If something happens, I should go{LF}get Dr. Natalie?
Whaaaaaa! Whaaaaa!{LF}My stomach hurts!!!
Cammy!{LF}Are you okay?
Ow! It hurts!{LF}Hey, where's the doctor?
Uh, she's out at the moment.
What?!{LF}But my stomach hurts!!!{LF}Whaaaa! Whaaaa!
Uh, wait just a minute.{LF}I'll go get her right now.
Okay....
(I'd better find the doctor while {LF}the clinic is still open, or this will {LF}be serious! Gotta hurry!)
Oh, I'm sorry.{LF}Could you come back during clinic hours?{LF}Weekdays from 9am until 6pm, okay?
Ok, Cammy.{LF}Let's see how you're doing.{LF}Does it hurt here?
No, that feels okay.
How about here?
Ouch! That hurts!
Okay. You're fine.{LF}You just ate too much.{LF}You'll feel better in a little while.
Really?{LF}Oh, good!{LF}I was so worried since{LF}it hurt so much.
What did you eat?
Popcorn, pancakes,{LF}and then apple juice with{LF}steamed jellyroll cake.
No wonder!{LF}Of course your stomach will hurt{LF}after pigging out like that!{LF}Why did you eat so much?
I had a fight with Roy and I{LF}got so mad I just ate everything.
Binge eating...{LF}You're about 10 years too young{LF}for that sort of thing.
Really?
Yes.{LF}No more overeating, okay?
Okay.{LF}Thank you, doctor!{LF}My stomach feels better now, so{LF}I'm going back home.
Great job once again, Natalie.
Well, it was an easy diagnosis.{LF}The problem usually is something{LF}simple.
Huh. Live and learn.
Sorry to take so much of your time.{LF}But, thanks to you, I found the herbs {LF}I needed. Thank you!{LF}Here's a token of my appreciation.
You got: ＠数字９＠G!{LF}
Thank you very much.{LF}By the way, Natalie,{LF}how can you go to a place with{LF}so many monsters?
Oh, my scalpel has some very serious{LF}enchantments on it. No monsters{LF}would dare mess with me.
Oh, really?
Yes. It's incredibly sharp.{LF}You can tell that Tanya made it.
It's so rare, even the royal doctors{LF}of Norad are envious of it.
Wow, that's really something.
I think she spends a little too much{LF}time with swords, but she certainly{LF}is talented.
Yes.
Thank you for your help today.{LF}I couldn't have done it without you.
＠カイル＠＠, you're always{LF}so helpful when I need something.
Next time you have a bad injury,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I'll fix you up{LF}for free, okay?
Sounds good! I'll try to be careful{LF}not to get hurt in the first place,{LF}though.
Alicia wants to become a fortune-teller!{LF}I just don't know what to do about her!
＠カイル＠＠, have you found{LF}something you'd like to do{LF}in the village?
I just love autumn.{LF}It's so relaxing.
Winter can be really tough, but{LF}before you know it, spring will be here!{LF}It's helps to remember that!
It's always nice to go to the park on{LF}a warm spring day and just do nothing!
In the summer, if you don't stay in the{LF}shade, you'll get heatstroke.{LF}It's a good idea to wear a hat.
I don't know about those crazy{LF}styles of hats that Alicia{LF}likes to wear, though.
It's easy to eat too much {LF}in autumn, so be careful.
I love the park when it's covered in{LF}snow. It's really lovely.
It's healthier to take a warm bath{LF}than a really hot one.
There's nothing better than a cold{LF}bath in the summer time!{LF}It's really refreshing!
I just love a long bath in the fall.{LF}How about you, ＠カイル＠＠?
It's easy to catch a chill after a bath{LF}in winter, so be careful.
Father Gordon is{LF}a friend of mine.
I've known Gordon since we were{LF}children. If you'd told me he'd become{LF}a priest back then, I would have told{LF}you you were crazy!
When you're sick, try not to sneeze{LF}or cough on your hands and then{LF}give your germs to others.
In some ways, it's easier to be a{LF}small-town doctor. It's a lot easier{LF}to keep germs from spreading when{LF}there are fewer people around.
I just love the cold, crisp{LF}air of the church in winter.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}is it an emergency?
Yes.{LF}Cammy says her stomach{LF}hurts.
Oh dear, that's awful.{LF}Let's hurry back.
Okay.
Hello. Nice to meet you, young{LF}man. I'm Natalie, the doctor{LF}in this village.
Nice to meet you too.{LF}My name is ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm living at Douglas and Mana's farm.
Ah, that's right... I heard someone{LF}new had moved to that farm.{LF}Tell me, have Douglas and Mana{LF}forced you to buy their goods?
Uh, well, kind of, actually!{LF}Heh heh...
Well, in truth, they really aren't{LF}bad people, so don't hold a grudge{LF}against them!
Ah, that's good to know.
When you work as a farmer, it's{LF}easy to overwork and wear yourself{LF}out. So always pay attention to your{LF}body as you farm.
I'll keep that in mind! Thanks{LF}for the advice!
Good morning.
Hello.
Good evening.
Oh, good morning.{LF}How are you?
Oh, hello.{LF}How are you?
Oh, good evening.{LF}How are you?
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You look like you're doing well today.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You look like you're doing well today.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You look like you're doing well today.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You always seem to be{LF}in good spirits.
Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You always seem to be{LF}in good spirits.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You always seem to be{LF}in good spirits.
Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.
Children, go to sleep.
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have another healthy year!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Have another healthy year!
Going to the Flower Festival today?{LF}＠カイル＠＠, do you have a{LF}favorite flower?
I like drinking better than looking{LF}at flowers! Ha ha ha!
Going to the Flower Festival today?{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you have a favorite flower?
An Eating Contest... Hm...{LF}Well, If there was a category{LF}for drinking, then I'd enter!{LF}Ha ha ha!
I can't believe you won the{LF}Eating Contest!
Well, it's fine even if you lose.{LF}There's always next year.
An Eating Contest...{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you want to enter?
Wow, you won the championship!
Well, it's fine even if you lose.{LF}There's always next year.
It's the 1st day of summer.{LF}I used to drive the men quite wild{LF}when I put on a bathing suit...{LF}*sigh*
Swimming season starts today.{LF}The ocean can be dangerous, so{LF}be careful while you play.
Oh, the Monster Taming Contest...{LF}I worry about injuries every year.{LF}Messing around with monsters can be{LF}quite dangerous.
Wow. You did really well, ＠カイル＠＠!
Well, I'm just glad you {LF}didn't get injured.
Oh, a Monster Taming Contest...{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you want to enter?
You won! ＠アルス＠＠, {LF}you certainly are ＠カイル＠＠'s child!
Well, I'm just glad you {LF}didn't get injured.
Ah, the Dance Festival. It reminds me{LF}of the old days. Both Gordon and{LF}Douglas asked me to the festival back{LF}in the day.
There's a Dance Festival today.{LF}I guess it's not really meant for kids.
A Fishing Contest today...{LF}I'd rather eat fish than try to{LF}catch them.
＠カイル＠＠, you're really good{LF}at fishing, aren't you?{LF}I'm surprised!
Don't worry if you lose.{LF}It's no big deal.
Oh, the Big Cook-Off is today.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you like to cook?{LF}I'm no good at cooking.
Alicia isn't good at it either.{LF}I wonder who she takes after...
＠アルス＠＠, you're really good at cooking! I'm surprised!
Well, the most important thing {LF}in cooking isn't taste, it's nutrition.{LF}That's the truth. Especially for{LF}growing children.
It's the Adventure Contest today.{LF}*sigh* This usually leads to some{LF}injuries.
You're really something,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Well, at least you made it back{LF}safely.
There's an Adventure Contest today.{LF}There are always a lot of injuries.{LF}I'm worried about Ray.
You won! Great job!
Well, at least you made it back{LF}safely.
The Harvest Festival is today.{LF}A time to give thanks {LF}for the land's blessings.
The Harvest Festival is today.{LF}A time to give thanks {LF}for the land's blessings. Thanks to it, {LF}you've all grown up healthy.
Oh, today is the Monster Contest.{LF}I don't quite understand the purpose{LF}of this tournament.
＠カイル＠＠, you can do{LF}just about anything, can't you?{LF}I'm surprised!
Oh well, there's always a winner and{LF}a loser. Don't sweat it.
Oh, today is the Monster Contest.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you like monsters?
Wow, you won?!{LF}That's amazing!
Oh well, there's always a winner and{LF}a loser. Don't sweat it.
Oh, today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}It really reminds me of the old days.
Douglas or Gordon...{LF}I always worried over whose{LF}invitation to accept.
Oh, today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Children usually love this festival,{LF}since they get to stay up late.
There's a mining contest today.{LF}Don't hit your own foot{LF}with the hammer!
Hey, you won the contest!{LF}You're really something!
Well, at least you didn't pound{LF}your own foot.
There's a Mining Contest today.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you like to hammer?
Hey, you won the contest!{LF}You're really something!
Well, at least you didn't pound{LF}your own foot.
Well, that's it for this year.{LF}Have another year of good health,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Well, that's it for this year.{LF}Have another healthy year!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, did you look at the{LF}bulletin board for me?
Yes.
When I went to Herman's for a house {LF}call, I guess I left my {LF}＠アイテム９＠ behind.
I'm so busy, I just don't have time{LF}to go get it. Could you go look around{LF}for it? It would really help me out.{LF}Do you mind?
Not at all.{LF}That doesn't sound too tough.
Thanks!{LF}Go take a look in Herman's{LF}house, okay?
No problem.
Go find my ＠アイテム９＠ at{LF}Herman's house for me, please.
It's probably hidden under the furniture{LF}or somewhere like that, so{LF}you might not be able to see it.
Press the A Button on any place{LF}that looks suspicious.
Oh, you found my{LF}＠アイテム９＠?{LF}That's wonderful.{LF}May I have it, please?
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're such a big help.{LF}I'll let you know if I need you again.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thanks for coming.
You're welcome.
I'd like you to take this medicine {LF}to Byron. Could you do that for me?
Okay, but is Byron sick{LF}or something?
Oh he's okay, you're just delivering{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}It's just a vitamin drink.{LF}It's a got a good kick to it, though.
Okay.{LF}I'll do it.
Thank you. You're really a big help.
You take ＠アイテム９＠.
Oh but your backpack is full.{LF}Come back when it's not so full.
Please take{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Byron!
You delivered it for me?{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Here, a token of my appreciation.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Oh, I almost forgot.{LF}Do you need any wood, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, it certainly never hurts{LF}to have some around.
Douglas gave me way too much the other{LF}day, and it's just in the way, so{LF}I'll give you some.
You got 100 pieces of wood!{LF}
I'll let you know if{LF}I need you for something again.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're such a big help.{LF}I'll let you know if I need you again.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Could you do something for me?
Sure. What is it?
Could you bring Roy{LF}here for me?
Roy?{LF}Okay, but is he sick or something?
That child just hates getting shots.{LF}Well, all children hate getting{LF}shots, but...
Maybe you can convince him to come{LF}with you, man-to-man, you know?
Okay.{LF}I'll give it a try.
Thank you. You're really a great help.
Please bring Roy here right away.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're such a big help.{LF}I'll let you know if I need you again.
Oh, I'm sorry.{LF}Could you come to the 1st floor {LF}during clinic hours? Weekdays, 9 to 6.
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠. I was planning{LF}to give you a ＠アイテム９＠,{LF}but it looks like I lost it!
I think it's at the school's library,{LF}so could you go take a look?
Okay!
Okay!
If you find it, it's yours.{LF}Give it to Mana at the school,{LF}and she'll fix one of your magic{LF}books for you.
The ＠アイテム９＠ is at the{LF}library, I think. Find it,{LF}and it's yours to keep.
Natalie, is anything wrong? {LF}I've been looking around {LF}the town for anything unusual.
Thank you for your hard work.{LF}But there's nothing out of the{LF}ordinary going on around here.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}what is it?
Uh... Are you and Alicia{LF}having a fight?
What?{LF}How did you know that?
I heard it from Ray.{LF}He was concerned about the{LF}two of you fighting.
I can't believe that child.{LF}He's just so sensitive. 
He'll need to toughen up if he{LF}wants to be a doctor some day.
I'll take your word for it.
Anyway, enough of that.{LF}I'm never forgiving Alicia! {LF}And if you see her, you can tell{LF}her that!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}good to see you!
Uh... Are you and Alicia{LF}having a fight?
What?{LF}How did you know that?
I heard it from Ray.{LF}He was concerned about the{LF}two of you fighting.
I can't believe that child.{LF}He's just so sensitive. 
He'll need to toughen up if he{LF}wants to be a doctor some day.
I'll take your word for it.
Anyway, enough of that.{LF}I'm never forgiving Alicia! {LF}And if you see her, you can tell{LF}her that!
(I have to deliver the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}that Alicia gave me.)
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
I just love spring.
Going to the Flower Festival{LF}tomorrow? I'll be there!
Earthquakes are so scary!{LF}If we ever have a big one, I'm not{LF}sure I'll be able to tend to all{LF}the injuries.
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest.{LF}If there's a drinking contest, {LF}I'm in. Ha-ha-ha!
Swimming season starts tomorrow.{LF}Swimming can be dangerous,{LF}so be careful.
Tomorrow is the Monster Taming Contest.{LF}It's really an unusual festival.
There was another earthquake.{LF}I wonder if anyone was{LF}hurt.
It sure is hot.{LF}Be sure to drink plenty of water{LF}when you're out in the fields.
Oh, tomorrow is the Dance Festival.{LF}When I was young, I'd look forward{LF}to the Dance Festival all year!{LF}Hee hee hee!
Tomorrow is the Fishing Contest. I{LF}still remember the year when Douglas{LF}got a hook in his backside.{LF}Gordon swore it was an accident...
Are you competing in the{LF}Adventure Contest, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Be careful not to get hurt.
Another earthquake?{LF}They're starting to get a little{LF}ominous...
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival.{LF}A good meal is truly the best medicine.
People's appetites seem to increase {LF}in fall. Everyone eats too much.
Oh, tomorrow is the Monster Contest.{LF}I'm not very interested.
Tomorrow is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I just hope it's not cloudy.
It's really gotten cold, hasn't it?{LF}Be careful not to catch a cold.
Tomorrow is the Mining Contest.{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I think a hammer{LF}would suit you well.
We had another earthquake.{LF}I wonder if something is going on.
Tomorrow, another year will be over.{LF}I'm thankful it was a peaceful year.
＠アルス＠＠, do you like spring?
＠アルス＠＠, do you like summer?{LF}It's nice to play in the ocean.
Autumn is a good time to read books.{LF}You must study while you're still young.
Winter is for skiing.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, have you ever tried it?
Do you like it here in Alvarna,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I love living in Alvarna.
I was born here, so{LF}of course, I'm very attached to it.
Have you been eating{LF}a proper breakfast?{LF}Breakfast is a very important meal.
Are you eating a good lunch?{LF}You're young, so be sure to get enough {LF}to eat or you won't grow.
Your evening meal should{LF}be something light.
My favorite things are{LF}＠アイテム０＠{LF}and ＠アイテム１＠.
My favorite things are{LF}＠アイテム０＠{LF}and ＠アイテム１＠.{LF}Do you like them, ＠カイル＠＠?
My favorite things are{LF}＠アイテム０＠{LF}and ＠アイテム１＠.{LF}I like any kind of pudding.
＠カイル＠＠, have you made{LF}some friends?
I'm good friends with Douglas{LF}and Gordon.{LF}They're my childhood friends.
＠カイル＠＠, have you made{LF}some friends?
I'm good friends with Douglas{LF}and Gordon.
Douglas is very protective of {LF}his daughter, Mana, so if you want{LF}to get to know her, you'll have to{LF}go through him first! Ha-ha-ha!
＠カイル＠＠, have you made{LF}some friends?
I'm good friends with Douglas{LF}and Gordon.
Gordon doesn't really{LF}seem much like a priest.
I want to study more{LF}so I can cure more people's {LF}injuries and illnesses.
I'd love to study the latest medicine{LF}in the capital city of Norad.
Nighttime is perfect for studying.
＠カイル＠＠, you're bright and{LF}energetic, even in the morning.
＠カイル＠＠, have you done {LF}anything fun lately?
I just love to have a drink after work.{LF}Nothing beats it. Oh, but it's still{LF}the afternoon...
Well, it's getting late. I think{LF}that's enough work for today.
My favorite thing is{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is that strange?
My favorite thing is{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is that what you guessed?
My favorite thing is{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Are you surprised?
I really don't care for the clothes{LF}young people wear nowadays.{LF}Couldn't everyone just wear white gowns?
When I wear this hat,{LF}people often say I look more like{LF}a nurse than a doctor.
Your clothing is a little{LF}unusual, too, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What kind of fashion is it?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you heard the rumors lately that a{LF}ghost has been walking by the clinic?
What a bunch of superstitious{LF}nonsense.
I've heard stories about the clinic {LF}ghost a lot lately.
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}heard anything?
There's a rumor that in the middle of {LF}the night, a ghost walks past the{LF}clinic. Have you heard that?
I guess it comes out about this time?{LF}Let's try to catch it! I want to{LF}put this silly rumor to rest!
I hate {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is that strange?
I hate {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Did you know that?
I hate {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Do you hate it too, ＠カイル＠＠?
＠カイル＠＠,  I wonder if{LF}you know my birthday.{LF}Oh, I guess I never told you.
My birthday is on the 21st of Spring.{LF}I just thought I'd let you know.
＠カイル＠＠,  I wonder if{LF}you know my birthday.{LF}Oh, I guess I never told you.
My birthday is on the 21st of Spring.{LF}I just thought I'd let you know.
＠カイル＠＠,  I wonder if{LF}you know my birthday.
My birthday is on the 21st of Spring.{LF}I just thought I'd let you know.
Do you like me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh?　Well, um...
I don't really think about you.
I'm just joking.{LF}You're cute when you're embarrassed.
Well, that's a cold response.
Do you like me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh?　Well, um...
I don't really think about you.
I'm just joking.{LF}You're cute when you're embarrassed.
Well, that's a cold response.
Do you like me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh?　Well, um...
I don't really think about you.
I'm just joking.{LF}You're cute when you're embarrassed.
Well, that's a cold response.
Is farming fun, ＠カイル＠＠?
You're a man, so{LF}work hard and show some sweat.
I recommend some leisurely{LF}rest at night.
You have amnesia, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes.
People's memories are a strange thing.{LF}Even with the latest medical knowledge{LF}there's so much we don't understand.
You have amnesia, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes.
Even though your memory of your past{LF}is gone, you still remember language{LF}and words. The human brain is so{LF}fascinating.
You have amnesia, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes.
I believe our memories are stored in the{LF}brain, but some people think it's{LF}in our hearts.
I don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Don't you forget it!
I don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Don't give me that for a present, okay?
I don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}I can't even stand looking at it.
＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}plans for the future?
I haven't decided on anything yet.{LF}For now, I'm just enjoying farming.
Oh.{LF}Well, you're still young.{LF}You should try lots of different things.
＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}plans for the future?
I haven't decided on anything yet.{LF}For now, I'm just enjoying farming.
When you're young, the possibilities are{LF}unlimited. Good luck.
＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}plans for the future?
I haven't decided on anything yet.{LF}For now, I'm just enjoying farming.
I always loved dreaming about my{LF}future late at night, all alone.
Colds can pass from person to person{LF}very easily. When you're sick, try{LF}to keep your germs from spreading!
Germs are all around us, but don't{LF}spend too much time worrying about{LF}them. Everyone gets sick now and{LF}again.
Being a doctor can be difficult, but{LF}it's worth it for the satisfaction{LF}that I get from helping people.
I wish I could get Alicia to give up {LF}her dream of becoming a fortune-teller.{LF}But what can I do?
As a doctor, I just can't approve{LF}of something as unscientific as{LF}fortune-telling.
So, why on earth does my own{LF}daughter want to be something{LF}as ridiculous as a fortune-teller?
I've always been so strict with{LF}Alicia, ever since she was a baby.{LF}Maybe I've been too hard on her?
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}ever given marriage any thought?
What?{LF}Uh, well...
Well, you're still young.
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}ever given marriage any thought?
What?{LF}Uh, well...
I wonder what kind of girl is your{LF}type, ＠カイル＠＠. Hee hee hee.
＠カイル＠＠, have you {LF}ever given marriage any thought?
What?{LF}Uh, well...
If you think you might like Mana, well,{LF}that's a tough one. With a father like {LF}hers, she'll never get married!{LF}Ha ha ha!
When I was young, I could drink{LF}Gordon and Douglas under the table.
Come to think of it, I still can.{LF}Ha ha ha!
When I was young, I could drink{LF}Gordon and Douglas under the table.
Come to think of it, I still can.{LF}Ha ha ha!
When I was young, I could drink{LF}Gordon and Douglas under the table.
Come to think of it, I still can.{LF}Ha ha ha!
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the "Forest of Beginnings"?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
If monsters come from the Forest of{LF}Beginnings, then I wonder where{LF}humans come from?
Oh, so you already know about it.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the "Forest of Beginnings"?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
It's where monsters come from from,{LF}and where they go when they're{LF}defeated.
Wow, you're certainly well informed.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the "Forest of Beginnings"?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
I'd love to go there once.{LF}I bet I could improve my medicine there.
Oh, you know about it already.
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything about{LF}the village that you don't like?
I've always hated the fact that we don't{LF}have a place to go drink.
Instead, everyone in the village comes{LF}to my place to drink!
We really should build a bar,{LF}shouldn't we? Ha ha ha!
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything about{LF}the village that you don't like?
I've always hated the fact that we don't{LF}have a place to go drink.
Instead, everyone in the village comes{LF}to my place to drink!
I actually like drinking, so I always{LF}have all kinds of stuff to drink.
＠カイル＠＠, is there anything about{LF}the village that you don't like?
I've always hated the fact that we don't{LF}have a place to go drink.
Instead, everyone in the village comes{LF}to my place to drink! But nothing {LF}beats an evening drink at a bar!
The power of the earth is amazing...{LF}Compared to that, the power of humans{LF}doesn't amount to much, does it?
We all get our strength from{LF}the earth, don't we?
Even when I sleep at night, the earth{LF}never rests. It just keeps supporting{LF}all of us.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragons?
They're legendary dragons. If someone {LF}defeated one, I'll bet its magic could{LF}be used to make a really powerful{LF}medicine!
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragon?
It's a dragon of legend, and according{LF}to the story, its tail can be made into{LF}medicine for eternal youth and longevity.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragons?
They're legendary dragons, said to{LF}possess incredible powers. I wonder{LF}if those powers could somehow be{LF}harnessed for healing...
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I think it's a good thing that{LF}you came to this village.{LF}Thank you!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I think it's a good thing that{LF}you came to this village.{LF}Thank you!
You make everyone feel{LF}a little more cheerful.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I think it's a good thing that{LF}you came to this village.{LF}Thank you!
I hope you stay in the village{LF}forever!
Don't do anything too dangerous,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠, have you made some friends?{LF}Friends are the most important.
＠アルス＠＠, you've really started{LF}to look like ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}haven't you?
＠アルス＠＠, are you enjoying school?{LF}Your father built that school,{LF}you'd better study and{LF}work hard!
＠アルス＠＠, the children are the future{LF}of this village.{LF}So, work hard!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠, come in.{LF}If you're feeling bad, have Ray{LF}take a look at you.
It's hot again today, {LF}isn't it, ＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠, you're full{LF}of energy again today.
You children are always so full of{LF}energy.
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠, going to the bath?
You get so sweaty in the summer,{LF}it makes you want to take 2 baths a day.
＠アルス＠＠, do you like the bath?
Want to get in together, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Just kidding...
That breeze feels nice.
This time of the day, it's not too hot,{LF}and it feels so pleasant.
It's starting to get colder.
It really gets cold this time of year.
This is no place to play.{LF}No running!
＠アルス＠＠, you pray quietly too.
It's such a nice time of the year.
This church is cold.
Nothing is more important than health.
Eat lots of food,{LF}and grow big and strong.
＠アルス＠＠, you've been getting hurt{LF}a lot lately. What have you been doing?
You've had some bad injuries lately,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Are you okay?
You've been getting hurt so often{LF}that Ray's been worried about you.
＠アルス＠＠, playing hard is fine, but{LF}be careful not to get hurt.
It seems like the spirits of the village{LF}have improved lately.{LF}Everyone looks so happy.
I heard that your father came back,{LF}＠アルス＠＠! I bet you're really{LF}happy.
Oh, this is it!{LF}This is what I wanted!
Thanks!{LF}Here's ＠数字９＠G for your trouble!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
＠カイル＠＠, you've really{LF}got what it takes.{LF}I was wrong about you.
(You were wrong about me? I don't recall{LF}doing anything to Alicia to make her{LF}misjudge me, but...whatever...)
If I need something from you again,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I'll put it{LF}on the bulletin board, okay?{LF}Be sure to check it occasionally.
Is this for me?
Oh, this is it!{LF}This is just what I need to{LF}improve my fortune-telling!{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
No problem.
Well, here...{LF}Here's ＠数字９＠G for my thanks!
You got ＠数字９＠G!{LF}
＠カイル＠＠, you're really dependable.{LF}I predict that we could fall madly{LF}in love...
Ha ha ha!
Hey, I'm not kidding...{LF}Do you want me to read your fortune{LF}and see if I'm right?
Uh, no thanks.{LF}Not this time.
Is this for me?{LF}Really?
You found it.
Yes. I found it.
＠カイル＠＠, according to my fortune,{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠ is something{LF}that will be given to me as a{LF}marriage proposal.
But I really don't feel that way yet, {LF}you know? ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you understand, don't you?
Yeah, well, I guess.
Anyway, I'll give this{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}back to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll leave it up to you whether to{LF}give it to me again someday, or to{LF}throw it away.
Okay.
＠カイル＠＠, according to my fortune,{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠ is something{LF}that will be given to me as a{LF}marriage proposal.
A...proposal?
That's right. The man who brings me{LF}a CRYSTAL BALL is the man I'm{LF}destined to marry.
You're not joking?
No. I'm serious.{LF}My feelings for you{LF}are the real thing.
Wow. Alicia...
I love you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}And it's not just some silly fortune{LF}that I'm trying to make come true.{LF}I really do love you.
Alicia...
Please marry me.
I'm not quite prepared for this.
You really want to marry me?
Yes.{LF}I love you too, Alicia.{LF}Your fortune was dead-on this time.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm so happy!
But what do you mean by {LF}"this time"?{LF}My fortunes are never wrong!
I know, I know.  Ha-ha-ha!
Now I understand your feelings{LF}about this, Alicia.
But I haven't sorted out {LF}my feelings quite yet.
I understand.{LF}I'll give this ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll leave it up to you whether to{LF}give it to me again someday, or to{LF}throw it away, ＠カイル＠＠.
Okay.
Not yet. I haven't figured out how {LF}I feel yet.
Okay.
I'll give this ＠アイテム９＠ back.{LF}I'll leave it up to you whether to{LF}give it to me again someday, or to{LF}throw it away, ＠カイル＠＠.
Alicia.{LF}Will you marry me?
Do you really mean it?
Of course! I want to marry you and{LF}make you happy.{LF}You do predict a happy future for{LF}us, right?
Of course! I predict that we'll live{LF}happily ever after!
I'm flattered at the proposal. Even if {LF}my fortune reading is wrong, you'd {LF}still want to marry me, right, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm so happy! I love it!{LF}Thank you!
But if you really want to capture{LF}my heart, get your fortune read!
What! I absolutely hate this!{LF}I don't want it.
I'm so happy! I love it!{LF}Thank you!
What! I absolutely hate this!{LF}I don't want it.
You want me to drink this?{LF}Okay, but....
Wow, it's tastes delicious.{LF}Thank you.
You want me to drink this?{LF}Okay, but....
Wow, it tastes delicious.{LF}Thank you.
You want me to drink this?{LF}Okay, but....
Wow, it tastes delicious.{LF}What's happening? You look{LF}really handsome, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}
I love this, but...{LF}I would have liked it on my birthday.
I'm so happy!{LF}My fortune said that I would get{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}on my birthday!
I'm flattered, but I hate to keep {LF}getting this over and over.
I love this, but...{LF}I would have liked it on my birthday.
I'm so happy!{LF}My fortune said that I would get{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}on my birthday!
I'm flattered, but I hate to keep {LF}getting this over and over.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Well, I can't say I like it{LF}or hate it...
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Well, I can't say I like it{LF}or hate it...
Wow, Mana's house is really cozy!
I guess if I'm no good{LF}at fortune-telling,{LF}I could open a general store?
Running a store is not such a bad idea.{LF}I want to have a fortune-telling place!
It's really gotten cold, hasn't it?{LF}I want to eat something warm like stew.
I wonder why my predictions{LF}are never right?{LF}I always get the weather forecast right.{LF}But nothing else...
Well, it sure is hot.
Autumn is a lonely season, so{LF}fortune-telling is really popular.
In winter, of course,{LF}everyone thinks of fortune-telling.{LF}I don't know why!
I just want to talk.
Give me a prediction.
Oh, never mind.
Okay, I'll give you a prediction{LF}that's so accurate, it's spooky!
Okay, I'll give you a prediction{LF}so accurate, it'll knock your{LF}socks off!
Okay, I'll give you a prediction{LF}that's so accurate, it's spooky!
Okay, I'll give you a prediction{LF}so accurate, it'll knock your{LF}socks off!
Weather Reading.
Location Reading.
Love Reading.
Oh, never mind.
Tomorrow's weather.
I want it to be sunny tomorrow.
I want it to rain tomorrow.
Oh, never mind.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
I can see it...!{LF}Tomorrow will be sunny!
Okay, that's 10G.
I can see it...!{LF}Tomorrow will be rainy!
Okay, that's 10G.
I can see it...!{LF}It will snow tomorrow!
Okay, that's 10G.
I can see it...!{LF}Tomorrow will be stormy!
Okay, that's 10G.
That will be a little tricky.{LF}But, for 100G, I'll give it{LF}my best try!
Pay.
Quit.
La-lee-loo-la!{LF}La-lee-loo-la!
There you go! Now it will definitely{LF}be sunny tomorrow! Aren't I amazing?
That will be quite difficult.{LF}But, for 1,000G, I'll give{LF}it a try!
Pay.
Quit.
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahlaha!
Now it will rain tomorrow, thanks{LF}to my amazing powers!{LF}You're welcome!
Thanks for your business!|{LF}Come again soon!
Oh no, you don't have enough money!{LF}Well, I'll let it slide this time, but{LF}next time you'll have to pay, okay?
Douglas, Mana
Julia
Natalie, Alicia, Ray
Others
Gordon, Dorothy, Cammy
Egan, Cecilia, Jake
Tanya, Roy
Others
Byron, Barrett
Herman, Rosalind, Max
Yue
Actually, I changed my mind.
Okay, I'll give you a location reading.
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Hmmm.... I can see it! I see it{LF}clearly!
＠キャラ０＠ is{LF}at ＠マップ０＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠, and
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠,
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠, and
＠キャラ２＠ is in{LF}＠マップ２＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
That'll be 20G.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
Mana seems to be thinking about you{LF}quite a lot.
Me? Well... If I were to try to guess {LF}my own feelings, then it wouldn't be{LF}fortune-telling, would it? Ha ha ha.
Dorothy seems pretty interested in you.
Looking at Cecilia,{LF}I'd say she's been {LF}dreaming about you...
Well, you know how Rosalind is...{LF}But still, it seems she's got quite{LF}the thing for you.
Yue doesn't come around here much, {LF}but it seems like she always looks{LF}forward to seeing you.
I'm sorry to have to say this,{LF}but it doesn't look like anyone {LF}likes you yet.
Well, that's what I see, anyway.{LF}That'll be 20G.
Oh, really?{LF}Well, come back anytime, okay?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}that's unusual.
What are you all doing here together?
Talking.{LF}Just talking.
When the three of us {LF}are chatting together,{LF}it's easy to lose track {LF}of the time.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You should let me read {LF}your fortune sometime.
Oh? Okay, sure.{LF}Yeah, sometime.
Are you sure, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}What if you have{LF}a bad fortune?
Hey, Mana.{LF}Don't talk like that,{LF}you'll cost me business.
Well, aren't I right?
My readings are always right!
That's just because you always{LF}do something to make sure {LF}they come true!
If someone's fortune says, {LF}"Watch out for injuries,"{LF}wouldn't you run and tackle {LF}them from behind?
I would not!
I think you would.
That's it!
Hey now, you two,{LF}you're scaring ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, no, uh, don't mind me.
You've come at just {LF}the right time,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What is it?
I was just doing a reading{LF}to see if you liked any of {LF}the girls in this town.
What?
You're just guessing.{LF}There's no way you can see that.
Well, we'll see.
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Oh my, it looks like ＠カイル＠＠{LF}likes Mana.
What?!{LF}R-Really?
Ah, um, what?
My readings are always spot-on.{LF}There's no doubting it.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you like me?
Oh, it looks like ＠カイル＠＠{LF}likes Dorothy.
Oh, it looks like ＠カイル＠＠{LF}likes Ceci.
What? I-is that true?{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, it looks like ＠カイル＠＠{LF}likes Rosalind.
Oh, it looks like ＠カイル＠＠{LF}likes Yue.
Ah, um, no. What?
Alicia's fortunes {LF}aren't right at all!{LF}I'm sure of it now!
Hmm, it looks like he{LF}doesn't like anyone yet.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's cold out today, isn't it?
Hi, Alicia.{LF}It sure is.
Shall I warm you up, ＠カイル＠?
What?!
That's awfully bold of you to {LF}come right out and say, Mana.
What?{LF}No, I meant, "Would you like me to {LF}make you something to warm you up?"
Parks are nice in the spring,{LF}aren't they?
Don't you wish there was better{LF}shade in the park during the summer?{LF}Well, I guess if I had a hat, {LF}it would be okay.
I bet if someone started selling{LF}yams out here,{LF}they'd make a lot of money.
You'd think if someone started selling{LF}hot chocolate in the winter out here,{LF}they'd make a lot of money.{LF}That's what my readings tell me, too.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}were you trying to {LF}eavesdrop on our gossip?
N-No, of course not!
Ha ha ha.
You shouldn't tease {LF}＠カイル＠＠ so much.
It's so peaceful.
Baths are like laundry for the soul.{LF}I love them.
I love taking a bath in the summer.{LF}It's so refreshing.
There's nothing quite like {LF}a nice, hot bath when {LF}it's cold outside.
Baths are really the {LF}best in the winter,{LF}don't you think?
I'm so bored right now.
Mana's room is cozy, isn't it?{LF}I feel more comfortable here{LF}than in my own home.
Ah, fall...{LF}I feel like eating some pumpkin pie.
I don't like winter very much.
Don't you think Mana is just too cute?
Alicia, don't say strange things{LF}to ＠カイル＠＠ like that!
Why are taking it so seriously, Mana?{LF}It's not because...
Not you too, Ceci!
When the three of us talk{LF}like this, it's easy to lose {LF}track of the time.
Yeah, it sure is.{LF}But it's fun.
Well, I guess we don't {LF}have much else to do, anyway.
Ah, fall...{LF}I feel like eating some pumpkin pie.
Oooh, that sounds good.{LF}But I'll get fat.
I can eat as much as I want{LF}without putting on weight.{LF}Strange, huh?
It's probably something to{LF}do with being an elf.
Although I'm half-elf myself.
Ah, winter... {LF}According to my fortune-telling,{LF}spring should come next.
I'm pretty sure that's not {LF}fortune-telling, Alicia.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Alicia's fortunes are {LF}pretty much all like that.
Time to make some money!
Time to make some money!
Summer is the best time{LF}for a Love Reading.
Fall really is the best time{LF}for a Love Reading.
Winter is such a lonely season.{LF}I recommend a Love Reading.
Oh. ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}This is a strange place{LF}to meet, isn't it?
Alicia, sorry to make you wait.
It's okay, I just got here myself.
Well, my reading said{LF}we should start seeing{LF}falling stars soon.
I'm nervous.
Your reading said we'd be{LF}able to see shooting stars?{LF}I wonder if it will come true.
Of course it will!{LF}My readings always come true!
Look! A falling star!{LF}I was right!
You were.
I'm so happy!{LF}But I forgot to make a wish.
Oh well.{LF}There'll be more.
Look, did you see?
You're on a roll.
I really am an amazing {LF}fortune-teller after all!
Look, another one!
There's a lot tonight,{LF}isn't there?
It makes me happy to{LF}see my fortunes come true.
I'm happy too.{LF}To see you smiling like that.
Oh...? 
I-I'm happy, too.{LF}Just to watch the falling {LF}stars with you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Really?
Yeah, it's not a fortune or anything.{LF}Just my feelings.
Thanks for inviting me tonight,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I had a good time.
Me too.
Okay, talk to you later.
I want to talk.
I want you to read my fortune.
Never mind.
What do you want?
Good morning, dear.
Ahhh... We really got married.{LF}I'm...so happy.
I'm so happy to be married to you.
Are you happy to be married to me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I hope we can have a baby soon.{LF}If my reading is right,{LF}it shouldn't be too much longer.
You work so hard every day.
According to my reading,{LF}you're falling more and more {LF}in love with me.
Take good care of me, dear.
I haven't felt so good, lately.{LF}I feel...sick to my stomach.
Are you okay?
Yes...I think. {LF}I'm fine.{LF}According to my fortune... 
You don't need fortunes,{LF}just get some rest, okay?
I'm so happy to be married to you.
Good luck building the school, {LF}for ＠アルス＠＠'s sake.
Don't forget, Byron will only {LF}talk to you about it when{LF}you're in the first floor{LF}of our house.
I've got something important {LF}to tell you, dear.
What?
I-I'm having a baby.
R-Really?!{LF}Wow, that's great!
I know. I'm excited!
So... We're having a baby.{LF}I wonder if it's going to be{LF}a boy or a girl.
Hmm.{LF}Which would you rather have?
A boy.
A girl.
Either is fine.
I'd like to have a boy.{LF}How about you, Alicia?
I'd like to have a girl.{LF}How about you, Alicia?
It doesn't matter to me.{LF}I'm just happy to have a{LF}child with you.
Me too.{LF}I feel the same way!
So, it looks like our family {LF}is going to get a little bigger.
Let's keep working hard together, dear.
Of course!
I think the baby is going to come soon.
I've had the baby!
Fantastic, Alicia!
Look, it's a boy!{LF}He looks just like you.
Look, it's a girl!{LF}She looks just like you.
Ha ha, you think?
We'd better give the little one a name.{LF}Can you think of a good one?
＠アルス＠＠...{LF}What a fine name.{LF}I love it!
I'm glad.
＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Eat a lot, and grow up {LF}strong and healthy, okay?
Growing up...
What?
＠アルス＠＠ needs a school to go to.
You think so too?
Now that we have a child,{LF}you should talk to Byron about{LF}building a school.
Good luck building the school, {LF}for ＠アルス＠＠'s sake.
Oh!
Weather Reading.
Location Reading.
Never mind.
Tomorrow's weather.
I want it to be clear tomorrow.
I want it to rain tomorrow.
Never mind.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
I can see it...{LF}Tomorrow will be clear.
I can see it...{LF}Tomorrow will be rainy.
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be snowy.
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be stormy.
When we were single, I had you pay me{LF}100G, but I guess we don't need to{LF}bother with that now, do we?
La-lee-loo-la!{LF}La-lee-loo-la!
I've done it.{LF}Tomorrow is definitely {LF}going to be sunny now.
When we were single, I had you pay me{LF}100G, but I guess we don't need to{LF}bother with that now, do we?
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Okay, it'll rain tomorrow now.
Douglas, Mana
Julia
Natalie, Alicia, Ray
Someone else
Gordon, Dorothy, Cammy
Egan, Cecilia, Jake
Tanya, Roy
Someone else
Byron, Barrett
Herman, Rosalind, Max
Yue
Never mind.
Okay, I'll give you a location reading!
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Heh heh heh.{LF}I can see it! I've spotted you now!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠, and
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠,
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠, and
＠キャラ２＠ is in{LF}＠マップ２＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
That'll be 20G.{LF}Ha ha ha! {LF}I guess old habits die hard.
You don't want me to do a reading{LF}for you? I'm not going to take your{LF}money anymore.{LF}Ha ha ha.
Hold on! I can't talk right now!{LF}I'm reading your fortune!
Uh, okay...
Let's see what it says...{LF}Hmm... You're not from this{LF}town, are you?
Uh, that's right.
Really?! I did it! I really am{LF}an amazing fortune-teller after{LF}all!
(Of course I'm not from{LF}this town... I've never{LF}even seen you before...)
Ah! Right now, you're thinking,{LF}"Of course I'm not from this{LF}town! After all, we’ve never even{LF}met before!"
What? No, no, I wasn’t{LF}thinking that!
Hmph! Don’t lie! My readings{LF}are always right!
And even if they are {LF}off a little bit sometimes,{LF}who's to say I can't help{LF}make them happen?
(That's not exactly fortune-telling{LF}if you help MAKE your fortunes{LF}come true...)
Ah! Right now, you're thinking,{LF}"It’s not really fortune-telling{LF}if you help make your fortunes{LF}come true!"
What? No, no, of course I wasn't!
Hmph! Well, I think I've made{LF}my point... What's your name?
I'm ＠カイル＠＠.
My name’s Alicia! And, as you've{LF}probably surmised, I’m a fortune-{LF}teller!
I'm particularly good at love{LF}readings and foretelling the{LF}weather! It's nice to meet you!
Usually, I’m down at the pier{LF}reading fortunes. If you're{LF}interested, stop on by!
O-Okay!
Morning.
Good morning.
Hello.
Hello.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Oh, morning.
Good morning.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, Alicia.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, Alicia.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, Alicia.
Morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who you like right now?
Good morning.{LF}No, I think I'll pass for now.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who you like right now?
Hello.{LF}No, I think I'll pass for now.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who you like right now?
Good evening.{LF}No, I think I'll pass on that for now.
Morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who I like right now?
(That's not fortune-telling at all!)
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who I like right now?
(That's not fortune-telling at all!)
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Hey, would you like me to try to{LF}see who I like right now?
(That's not fortune-telling at all!)
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hi there, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I don't think a child should be out {LF}playing around at this hour.
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I'm looking forward to reading{LF}your future for another year!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}
Today is the Flower Festival.{LF}According to my fortune,{LF}you're going to ask me out today.
(Ha ha ha, I guess she's telling {LF}me to ask her out.)
Want to go look at the flowers?
Do you like cherry blossoms?
Today is the Flower Festival, isn't it?
Would you like to go {LF}flower-gazing with me?
My reading was right after all.{LF}Yes, I would.{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}is the best place to go for flowers.
＠カイル＠＠, according to my fortune,{LF}you've already asked another girl out,{LF}haven't you?
You should stick with one woman{LF}at a time, ＠カイル＠＠.
Those flowers are beautiful.{LF}It feels good to have {LF}my reading come true.
The Flower Festival, huh...{LF}I wonder if anyone is going {LF}to ask me out...
Let's meet at {LF}＠マップ９＠.
Thanks for inviting me.{LF}I had a good time, and besides,{LF}it's satisfying to know {LF}my reading was true.{LF}
Today is the Flower Festival, isn't it?{LF}＠アルス＠＠, is there {LF}someone you're going to ask out?
So today is the Eating Contest...{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Wow, you won the Eating Contest?{LF}I never would have foreseen that!
I had a premonition that you would lose.{LF}I guess I was right on the money.
So today is the Eating Contest...{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Not bad for a kid!
Don't worry, you'll win next time.
It's the 1st day of summer.{LF}According to my fortune,{LF}it'll be hot out today.
Swimming season starts today.{LF}Do you like to swim, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today is the {LF}Monster Taming Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You've surprised me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
It's okay. You can always compete{LF}again next year.
Today is the {LF}Monster Taming Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
You won?{LF}That's incredible!
Don't worry, you can't win them all.
So today is the Dance Festival...{LF}My fortune predicted that you'd{LF}come up and say to me...
Please dance with me.
Um...never mind.
Uh? Oh, really?{LF}Yes, I would love to!
That's awful sweet of you to ask, {LF}but...{LF}Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh.
Thanks for being my date today.{LF}Of course, my fortune did predict{LF}that you would ask me.
Sorry that I couldn't go with you today.{LF}Please ask again, next year, okay?
Haven't you already danced {LF}with someone else?{LF}According to my fortune, that's not{LF}going to lead to a very happy future.
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}Are you going to go?
Today is the Fishing Contest.{LF}Are you going to try fishing today,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Wow, you're quite the fisherman,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! That's impressive.
I guess you're not very good at{LF}fishing, are you? Don't let it get{LF}to you. Nobody can be an expert at{LF}everything!
Today is the Big Cook-Off.{LF}I bet you're a pretty good chef,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I knew it! {LF}You're pretty good at cooking, huh?{LF}Just as my fortune told me.
Oh, you don't cook much, do you?
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}According to my fortune...{LF}Well, I'd better not say.
That's wonderful, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}The cards said you'd {LF}become a fine adventurer.
I guess adventuring{LF}just isn't your thing.
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter it,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
That's amazing, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}And to think you're still a kid!
You didn't like adventuring?
Today is the Harvest Festival.{LF}It's a lot of fun.
Today is the Harvest Festival.{LF}Are you having a good time,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today is the Monster Contest.{LF}I like this festival, myself.
No way!{LF}＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you really did it!
Women don't like sore losers.{LF}I don't need to do a reading{LF}to know that much.
Today is the Monster Contest.{LF}Personally, I like this festival.{LF}Do you like it too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
No way!{LF}＠アルス＠＠, {LF}you really did it!{LF}You're just like your father.
As long as you can{LF}take losing with grace,{LF}that's all that really matters.
Today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}My fortune said I'd be asked out by...
Would you go stargazing with me?
Um...never mind.
What, with you?{LF}Hold on, I need to check my fortune.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
Well, it said...{LF}I can go with you.
I'll meet you at{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9:00 tonight.
It's sweet of you to ask me,{LF}but my fortune says I can't{LF}go with you tonight. Sorry.
Of course,{LF}you had to look at{LF}your fortune to know.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at{LF}9:00. I hope we can see a falling star.{LF}I've heard that it's supposed to rain.{LF}Unless I change the weather, that is!
Sorry to turn you down like that,{LF}but it really was what my fortune {LF}told me to do.{LF}Please believe me.
I'm glad I got to see a shooting {LF}star with you tonight.{LF}The skies were clear after all.
Listen, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Aren't you already {LF}going with someone else?{LF}My reading reveals everything.
The Shooting Star Festival is so {LF}romantic, isn't it? Ah, but you{LF}probably don't understand why yet, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today is the Mining Contest.{LF}According to my fortune, {LF}you're going to do well,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Just as I predicted!
How strange.{LF}My readings usually aren't wrong.
Today is the Mining Contest.{LF}According to my fortune, {LF}you're going to do well,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Just as I predicted!
How strange.{LF}My readings usually aren't wrong.
Today is the last day of the year.{LF}And here's to the next one!{LF}Don't forget to get your fortune told.
Today is the last day of the year.{LF}And here's to the next one!{LF}Are you getting old enough to be {LF}interested in fortune-telling?
Did you see my message{LF}on the bulletin board?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.{LF}I have a favor to ask of you.{LF}I need you to be a fortune-telling{LF}test subject.
A fortune-telling test subject?
Exactly.{LF}I'll pay you ＠数字９＠G.{LF}What do you think?
Sure.{LF}So, what kind of fortunes {LF}are you reading today?
I'm practicing my wealth fortunes!{LF}Okay, here goes!
I'm ready.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
I see it!{LF}I see it clearly!
Wh-What do you see?
This isn't good. {LF}I see bad luck for you.{LF}You will soon have unexpected expenses.{LF}There's no doubt about it.
Wh-What? Really?{LF}I'd better be careful, then.
I can't wait to see if {LF}my reading comes true!
(That's good for you, {LF}but I'd rather not find out...)
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.{LF}Here's your payment, ＠数字９＠G.{LF}Thanks for helping.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Now my fortune-telling fee.{LF}It'll be 200G.
What? You're charging a fee?
Of course I am!{LF}I'm a fortune-teller,{LF}and I just told your fortune.{LF}Of course there's a fee.
(Let's see... {LF}I got ＠数字９＠G and paid 200G... {LF}That means I lost 100G!)
I'm looking forward to seeing if{LF}your fortune comes true.
I'm pretty sure it will.{LF}Actually, it already has.
Really?{LF}Ha ha! See, I am an amazing {LF}fortune-teller after all!
...
If you want your fortune told again,{LF}come see me any time.{LF}I'm usually reading fortunes {LF}down on the pier.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thanks for coming.
I want you to find me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}somewhere in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
I want to try using it {LF}in my fortune-telling.{LF}I'll give you ＠数字９＠G {LF}if you bring it to me. Thanks!
I want you to go to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and bring me back a {LF}＠アイテム９＠. Thanks!
Did you find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠?{LF}If you find one, please give it to me.
＠カイル＠＠, you're here!{LF}I've been waiting for you.
I have another favor to ask of you.{LF}I want you to go talk with Ceci.
Just talk to Cecilia?{LF}That's it?
Yes.{LF}And if you can, try to say something {LF}charming. Something to make her feel{LF}weak at the knees, you know I mean?
What?! No way!
Ha ha ha! Oh, come on!
What kind of favor is this, anyway?
Well, can you keep a secret?
Uh, sure, I guess...
Ceci had me read her love fortune.{LF}I told her that she would soon be {LF}approached by a handsome man.
Oh, I get it...
And there aren't that many {LF}young men in Alvarna, you see.
I just know Barrett and Jake would{LF}refuse to do it.{LF}And Max doesn't have the backbone.
There's always Ray, but really,{LF}This isn't something I'd want to ask{LF}my little brother to do.
So, that's how I settled upon{LF}you for the job, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Got it?
Uh, yeah. I mean, I see{LF}your dilemma, but...
Great! Now go talk to Ceci.{LF}I'll even give you a whole {LF}＠数字９＠G if you do it for me.
Um... Can I ask you one question?
What is it?
This... It's not really {LF}fortune-telling anymore {LF}if I do this, is it?
You just don't understand {LF}fortune-telling at all, do you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}It's all in the results!
As long as the fortune is right in{LF}the end, who cares how it happened?!
Uh, if you say so.
Okay then. Off with you!{LF}I'm counting on you!
Go talk to Ceci.{LF}I'm counting on you!
Here, I'll help you out a bit.{LF}I'll tell you where Ceci is right now,{LF}and I'll even tell you for free.
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Heh heh heh.{LF}I can see it! I've spotted you now!
Ceci is in {LF}＠マップ０＠.{LF}No doubt about it.
(At least she's always right about {LF}finding people. Maybe she does have{LF}a talent... Just what talent that is, {LF}I don't know.)
Well? Did you talk to Ceci?
Yes.
Thank you!{LF}Now my reading came true!
Here's your reward, as I promised.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks again.{LF}If I need anything else,{LF}I'll let you know.
＠カイル＠＠, you made it!{LF}I've been waiting for you.
I have another favor for you.{LF}I want you to ask Barrett who he likes.
Look, even if I go ask him,{LF}I don't think he'll tell me anything.
Just ask him straight.{LF}Talk to him man-to-man,{LF}and you'll be fine.
Right...
Okay, now, this is the important part.{LF}I need you to get him to say that{LF}he likes Dorothy.
How am I supposed to do that?!
Well, if he already likes her,{LF}it shouldn't be a problem,{LF}but I honestly don't have a clue {LF}what he thinks at all.
Okay, I'll go talk to him,{LF}and I'll ask who he likes,{LF}but I'm not going to try to{LF}change his mind, all right?
Fine, I guess.{LF}Just do your best.
Okay.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Go talk to Barrett.
Here, I'll help you out a bit.{LF}I'll tell you where Barrett is right {LF}now, and I'll even tell you for free.
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Heh heh heh.{LF}I can see it! I've spotted you now!
Barrett is in {LF}＠マップ０＠.{LF}No doubt about it.
(At least she's always right about {LF}finding people. Maybe she does have{LF}a talent... Just what talent that is, {LF}I don't know.)
Now hurry!{LF}I can't guarantee he'll stay {LF}in the same place for long!
Well? Did you talk to Barrett?
Yes.
And? Who does he like?{LF}Is it Dorothy?
He wouldn't say.
I see...{LF}So you're saying there's a chance.
(At least she can look {LF}on the bright side of things.)
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Here's the reward I promised.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
This time, I'll throw in{LF}100 pieces of wood{LF}as a special thanks.
You got 100 wood!
According to my reading,{LF}wood is going to be very{LF}important for you.
You think so?
I know so.{LF}If I need anything else,{LF}I'll let you know.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}There's something I need to{LF}talk to you about.
Sure, what is it?
You know how I tell {LF}love fortunes, right?{LF}And they always come true, right?
(No comment.)
You might not know this, but sometimes{LF}fortune-tellers try to read{LF}their own fortunes, too.
Really?
Of course.{LF}And sometimes we even try to read{LF}our own love fortunes.
Okay.
And...I tried to read my own fortune.{LF}My love fortune.
Right...
What do you think I saw?
You get proposed to by a handsome man.
You get proposed to by a wealthy man.
You get proposed to by a foreign prince.
You get proposed to by an average guy.
A handsome man...{LF}Well, looks are important,{LF}but there's more to a man than that.
A rich man...{LF}Well, money is nice,{LF}but it can't buy you everything.{LF}Most things...but not everything.
Wait, when you say a wealthy man,{LF}doesn't that narrow it down to Max?{LF}He's got no courage, no bravery! {LF}That's not attractive at all!
A foreign prince... Sounds nice,{LF}but from which country?{LF}If it's the prince of the Sechs Empire,{LF}then no way!
You know, in a lot of ways, {LF}average is the best.{LF}It's just not very thrilling.{LF}
Well, which was it?
It wasn't any of those.
So you mean... {LF}You don't get proposed to by anyone?
No, I don't!{LF}What's wrong with me?{LF}I thought I was attractive!
I've got a nice body, my face isn't bad,{LF}and my clothes... Well, they are a{LF}little eccentric, I suppose, but aren't{LF}there a lot of guys that are into that?
(I don't know if there's a lot, but...)
So why am I getting such a lousy{LF}fortune?!
Listen, Alicia, it's just a fortune.{LF}There's no guarantee that that's how{LF}things are going to turn out!
"Just" a fortune?{LF}"Just" a fortune?!{LF}Are you saying I'm a fraud?{LF}My readings are always right!
Oh, I didn't mean to doubt your{LF}fortune telling skills. You're probably{LF}right. You're probably going to be{LF}single for life!
What?! How could you say that?!{LF}You're so mean!
(It looks like I'm just {LF}digging myself deeper...)
Well, maybe you're right. Maybe my{LF}amazing prediction powers don't work as{LF}well when I use them on myself.
I'm glad I could be of help.{LF}Ha ha ha...
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're a good listener.
But... That means that if I get{LF}married, I'll prove my own reading{LF}wrong. Think of my professional{LF}reputation!
Isn't that quite a predicament?{LF}Fortune-telling is a hard life {LF}sometimes.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I've been waiting for you.
I have another fortune-telling {LF}job for you!
You want me to talk to someone again?
You got it!{LF}This time, it's Mana.{LF}Go on a date with Mana for me.
A date?{LF}Wh-Why? I can't do that!
You don't like her?
It's not that I don't like her, but...
Then there's no problem!{LF}It seems to me like she's got{LF}quite the thing for you, too.
R-Really?
So what are you waiting for?{LF}Go on and ask her out!
She's in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
O-Okay.
Good luck!
Mana is in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
That's one of her favorite places,{LF}you know. It's perfect for a date.
Did you go on a date with Mana?
She saw through it.
She did? So you weren't a good enough{LF}actor to pull it off, ＠カイル＠＠?
I just don't think you can force{LF}a love prophecy like this.
I see...{LF}Well, there's no helping it now.{LF}Since I'm so generous,{LF}I'll still pay you, of course.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'll just have to come up {LF}with a better plan next time.
＠カイル＠＠, I've been waiting for{LF}you!
I need you to go to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and find me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
I need it for my next fortune.{LF}I'll give you ＠数字９＠G {LF}if you bring it to me.{LF}Can you do that for me?
No problem.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}That's why I like you so much!
Umm...sure.
Sometimes I don't think {LF}you take me very seriously.
I want you to go to {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and find me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠. Thanks!
Did you find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠?{LF}If you find one, please give it to me.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You've made me happy.
＠カイル＠＠, I need your strength {LF}for this one. It's a pretty big{LF}favor.
What is it?
I want you to go to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and defeat an ＠モンスター９＠.
Is this for another{LF}one of your fortunes?
Why does everyone think my {LF}readings never come true on their own?{LF}But yes, it is for another of my{LF}fortunes. Will you do it for me?
Sure, I can do that.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}That's why I love you so much!
Yeah, yeah.
Hmph, I kind of meant it that time.{LF}Oh well, you better get going.
I want you to go to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and defeat{LF}＠モンスター９＠.
I knew you could do it,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thanks to you, my reading came true.
What kind of fortune was it?
Do you really want to know?
Of course.
Someone's fortune said that they {LF}would find true love with a {LF}a kind and strong man...
So that was all just to test my{LF}strength and see if I'm the{LF}man in the fortune?
You got it!
Umm...okay. {LF}So...whose fortune was it?
Oh, I couldn't tell you that!{LF}I have to keep the fortunes of my{LF}clients confidential. I'm a{LF}professional, after all!
Huh? But you've told me about lots of{LF}people's fortunes before...
Well, this is a special case.{LF}Ha ha ha...
Anyway, thank you.{LF}Here's your ＠数字９＠G.{LF}Go ahead, take it.
Thank you.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm happy that I could find{LF}a kind and strong man.
I just read a fortune, and... {LF}I want you to go on a date.
Who with?
With...me.
What?
Go on a date with me!{LF}If you don't, my reading will be wrong!{LF}What, does a date with me {LF}sound so bad to you?!
No, it's not that... 
Okay then. Good.{LF}You had me worried that my {LF}fortune wouldn't be true.{LF}
(I don't think this has anything{LF}to do with fortunes anymore...)
Okay, you're going to take me to{LF}＠マップ９＠.
Wh-Why there?{LF}Don't monsters appear there?
I don't have a choice.{LF}The fortune said that if we go there,{LF}the date will go well.
Hmm...if you say so, I guess.{LF}But it's pretty dangerous around{LF}there, Alicia.
Won't you protect me from any{LF}monsters, ＠カイル＠＠?
Of course I'll protect you.{LF}Just...be careful, okay?
I know, I know.{LF}Well, let's get going.
Oh, a date with you at {LF}＠マップ９＠!{LF}I think I'm going to blush.
I have an important favor to ask {LF}of you, ＠カイル＠＠.
What is it?
I need you to go to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and find me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
I require it to finish one {LF}of my greatest divinations.{LF}As a reward, I'll give you {LF}a whole ＠数字９＠G. What do you think?
Sounds good to me!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}That's why I like you so much.{LF}Marry me!
Yeah, yeah.
You're never going to believe I'm{LF}serious, are you?
Heh. Nope!
Fine then. I'll still be happy if{LF}you get me a ＠アイテム９＠!
Go to ＠マップ９＠{LF}and find me a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}It's very important.
Go to Padova Mts. - Ice Field to{LF}look for a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}If you find one, please give it to me.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You know, it's your choice.{LF}You can give it to me,{LF}or you could just throw it away.
What is it, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Do you need something?
Alicia,{LF}Did you have a fight with your mother?
H-How do you know about that, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I heard about it from Ray.{LF}He noticed that you two were{LF}having a fight.
He's as nosy as ever.
So, why are you having a fight?
The same as always.{LF}She doesn't believe that I should{LF}be a fortune-teller.
More than that, she told me that {LF}none of my readings would ever{LF}come true, so I foretold that she {LF}would lose something very dear to her.
Then I ate the{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}that she'd been looking forward{LF}to eating!
(That's not fortune-telling at all.)
I told her, "See, my prediction{LF}came true, didn't it?"{LF}She was furious with me.
(Yeah, of course she got mad.)
But isn't it a little childish {LF}to get so mad just because {LF}I ate one little snack?
Yes, but you shouldn't have done{LF}that in the first place, Alicia.
I know that.{LF}That's why I've bought another{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}to give to her.
I know, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Why don't you give it to her for me?{LF}It's kind of hard for me to do myself...{LF}Please?
Okay.
You receive a ＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, it looks like your{LF}backpack is full. {LF}You'll have to get rid of something.
Is mother still mad at me?{LF}I know she can be stubborn{LF}sometimes, too.
Did mother forgive me?
Yes, it's okay now.
Ahh, that's a relief.{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠, can I ask you{LF}something?
What is it?
What is it?
Why do you think I haven't{LF}been able to find a man yet?
W-Well, um, that's because... 
W-Well, um, that's because... 
Your love reading didn't come true.
There's a problem with your personality.
You're just too beautiful!
It's because the reading that told you{LF}you'd get married was wrong.
It's because the reading that told you{LF}you'd get married was wrong.
Eek! Well, that's true, but you{LF}don't have to be so blunt about{LF}it!
Anyway, that's enough! Begone!
(Well, you're the one who asked...)
(Well, you're the one who asked...)
Uh... Well, maybe your personality{LF}rubs some people the wrong way?
Uh... Well, maybe your personality{LF}rubs some people the wrong way?
M-My personality?{LF}There's nothing wrong {LF}with my personality!{LF}Well, nothing big, anyway...
(Hmmm... Looks like she might{LF}already know that her personality{LF}can be a bit of a problem{LF}sometimes...)
(Hmmm... Looks like she might{LF}already know that her personality{LF}can be a bit of a problem{LF}sometimes...)
Well, if you just work on the{LF}parts of your personality that{LF}you think are a problem, maybe{LF}you'll find that special someone?
Well, if you just work on the{LF}parts of your personality that{LF}you think are a problem, maybe{LF}you'll find that special someone?
Impossible. It's too late to change{LF}who I am.
So, uh, you're never getting married,{LF}then?
So, uh, you're never getting married,{LF}then?
That's enough! Begone!
(Well, you're the one who asked...)
(Well, you're the one who asked...)
You're just too beautiful, Alicia!{LF}Guys are probably intimidated by{LF}your good looks!
You're just too beautiful, Alicia!{LF}Guys are probably intimidated by{LF}your good looks!
Ah, you think so too, huh?{LF}That must be it, then!
It's so hard being beautiful{LF}sometimes! I'm glad you{LF}understand!
(Uh, I'm pretty sure there's{LF}another reason you haven't{LF}found a guy...)
(Uh, I'm pretty sure there's{LF}another reason you haven't{LF}found a guy...)
Thanks for talking with me today!{LF}Here, take this!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
If you give this to Mana{LF}when she's at the school,{LF}she can fix one of your{LF}magic books for you!
Thanks again!
Oh, it looks like your backpack{LF}is full. Talk to me again when{LF}you've got some free space in{LF}your backpack!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
If you give this to Mana{LF}when she's at the school,{LF}she can fix one of your{LF}magic books for you!
Thanks again!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Do you think I'm a good mother?
Why do you ask now?
Why do you ask now?
I just...got worried about it{LF}all of a sudden.{LF}What do you think?
You're a good mother.
I'm not sure.
Not really...
You're a good mother.{LF}I love you, Mom.
You're a good mother.{LF}I love you, Mom.
Thank you!{LF}That's such a relief!{LF}I feel better now.
Thanks for talking with me.{LF}Oh, yes. Here, take this, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure...
Hmm... I guess I need{LF}to try a little harder.
Thanks for talking with me.{LF}Oh, yes. Here, take this, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Not really...
Not really...
What?!{LF}I'm trying hard here!{LF}What's wrong with me?{LF}Tell me what's wrong with me!
(That's exactly what's{LF}wrong with you...)
(That's exactly what's{LF}wrong with you...)
Alicia, is anything bothering you?{LF}I'm going around town and making{LF}sure there aren't any problems.
Nope, nothing wrong here.{LF}I don't really have {LF}any problems right now.
Don't you think spring is the best?
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival.{LF}I can't help but get excited.
My reading didn't say anything{LF}about the earthquake.{LF}How strange...
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest.{LF}It's Herman's day to truly shine.
Summer starts tomorrow.{LF}For some reason, I don't think {LF}of summer as a good time for {LF}fortune-telling.
Tomorrow is the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. According to my reading...{LF}Actually, I'm not very interested in{LF}monsters, so it didn't say anything.
Another earthquake.{LF}And again I didn't see it in {LF}my reading...
It's so hot...{LF}Why don't I ever wear cooler clothes?
Tomorrow is the Dance Festival.{LF}I'm a little nervous, but I predict{LF}that I'll dance fabulously!
Tomorrow is the Fishing Contest.{LF}According to my fortune, {LF}you're going to do well,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Are you going to enter the Adventure {LF}Contest, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I predict you'd do well!
Another earthquake...{LF}And I still didn't see it coming..{LF}How strange...
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival.{LF}I don't need a reading to tell me{LF}that it's going to be a good time!
There are so many fattening {LF}foods in the fall.{LF}According to my fortune,{LF}if you eat too much, you'll get fat.
Tomorrow is the Monster Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Tomorrow is the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}I heard that if two lovers make a wish{LF}upon a falling star, it will come true,{LF}but I trust my readings more anyway.
It's been cold lately, hasn't it?{LF}The mornings have gotten{LF}so bad that I wish I could{LF}sleep until the afternoon.
Tomorrow is the Mining Contest.{LF}I think it's a lot easier to {LF}find good minerals than it is to {LF}tell a fortune that will come true.
But my readings always come true!
I didn't see this earthquake {LF}coming, either.{LF}It's enough to make me lose confidence.
According to my fortune,{LF}tomorrow will be the end of the year.{LF}I think next year will turn out well,{LF}too.
Spring is nice because it feels {LF}okay to just zone out sometimes.
But you're a kid, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}so I bet you need {LF}things to keep you busy.
It's so hot today...{LF}I mean, of course it's hot.{LF}It's summer, right?
Children should eat a lot{LF}and grow up nice and strong.
It's so cold today...{LF}I mean, of course it's cold.{LF}It's winter, right?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you like{LF}Alvarna?
Uh, sure, I guess...
I personally don't care for it that{LF}much... People in bigger cities{LF}appreciate my fortune-telling{LF}much more!
You don't seem like you have{LF}a lot to do, either, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}If you have some free time,{LF}you should let me read your fortune.
Fortune-telling is better at night,{LF}don't you think? It just has a {LF}better mood.
Too bad people in Alvarna don't{LF}go out at night much.
Did you eat your breakfast this morning?{LF}It's important to get a good meal {LF}at the start of the day.{LF}That's what my mother told me, at least.
Did you eat lunch today?{LF}Breakfast is important,{LF}but so is lunch, too.
Have you had dinner yet?{LF}It's important to have {LF}three full meals a day, you know.
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}What do you like, ＠カイル＠＠?
Have you made any friends yet,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with Mana and Ceci.
Ceci speaks harshly sometimes,{LF}but she's a nice girl.
Have you made any friends yet,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with Mana and Ceci.
Watch out for Mana, though.{LF}If you give her the slightest opening,{LF}she'll try to sell you {LF}things from her store.
Have you made any friends yet,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with Mana and Ceci.
Watch out for Mana, though.{LF}If you let down your guard even {LF}a little she'll try to sell you {LF}things from her store.
If you get to know someone better,{LF}you'll be able to go into{LF}their house in the evening.
Of course, you'll need to be on{LF}good terms with their parents too.
Hey, did you know?{LF}Humans first came from{LF}right here, in Norad.{LF}Isn't that amazing?
I wish I could go tell fortunes {LF}in the capital, even just once.
People say that humans first{LF}came from here in Norad,{LF}but I wonder how they know that?
You're in a good mood today, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Did something interesting happen to you?
A little bit ago, I was reading{LF}Ceci's fortune, and it said, {LF}"Watch out for water." She laughed,{LF}and wouldn't believe me!{LF}
So what else could I do, but fill{LF}up a bucket of water and run after her!{LF}Ha ha ha!
You're in a good mood today, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Did something interesting happen to you?
A little bit ago, I was reading{LF}Ceci's fortune, and it said,{LF}"Watch out for stairs." She laughed,{LF}and wouldn't believe me!{LF}
So as she was going down the stairs,{LF}I snuck up behind her...{LF}But I didn't push her or anything,{LF}of course! Ha ha ha!
It's nice and cool tonight.{LF}By the way, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}has anything interesting {LF}happened to you lately?
A little bit ago, I was reading{LF}Ceci's fortune, and it said, {LF}"Watch out for pitfalls." She laughed,{LF}and wouldn't believe me!{LF}
So what else could I do, but dig{LF}a big hole right in front of her door?{LF}That was a nice workout!
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Don't forget it!
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Don't forget it!
I really like a nice {LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Don't forget it!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you interested in fashion?
Me?{LF}No, not really.
I think a lot of people don't{LF}appreciate my style. What's wrong{LF}with the way I dress?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you interested in fortune-telling?
Me?{LF}Not really, no.
Fortunes come true, you know.{LF}You should let me read {LF}your fortune sometime.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what kind of fashion do{LF}you like on girls?
What?{LF}I don't know how to answer that...
Do you like my style?{LF}What do you think?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you heard the rumors about {LF}a ghost that walks around {LF}in front of the clinic?
Well, ghosts only come out {LF}at night so it doesn't {LF}matter right now.
Mana, Ceci, and I have been{LF}talking a lot lately about {LF}the ghost in front of the clinic.
Girls like to talk about{LF}that kind of thing,{LF}even though we get scared easily.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you heard the rumors about {LF}a ghost that walks around in front of{LF}the clinic in the middle of the night?
It's supposed to be around{LF}this time of night. Isn't it scary?{LF}Still, I kind of want to see for myself.
I really don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}I don't even want to look at it.
I really don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}I don't even want to look at it.
I really don't like{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}I don't even want to look at it.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
Oh, I guess I never told you.
You already know when my birthday is,{LF}right?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
It's the 28th of Summer.{LF}Don't forget it!
You already know when my birthday is,{LF}right?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know when my birthday is?
No, I don't...
Hey, how about acting a {LF}little interested?
You already know when my birthday is,{LF}right?
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of me?
Well, um...
I don't, really.
Oh, sorry,{LF}I probably shouldn't ask something{LF}like that so early in the morning.
Oh, I see.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of me?
Well, um...
I don't, really.
If you don't know, maybe I can read{LF}it in your fortune.
Oh, I see.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of me?
Well, um...
I don't, really.
I like you.
Come on, you can tell me.{LF}You're a man, aren't you?
Oh, I see.
What?!{LF}Really?{LF}I saw so in my fortune earlier, {LF}but it's really true!
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you enjoy farming?
It can feel good to work up a sweat{LF}in the middle of the day.
Fortune-telling is best at night,{LF}and farming is best in the day,{LF}don't you think?
You know that Max, {LF}over at Herman's place? {LF}I wonder if he likes anyone right now.
I have no idea.
Yeah, me neither.
You know that Max, {LF}over at Herman's place? {LF}I wonder if he likes anyone right now.
I have no idea.
Yeah, me neither.{LF}Maybe I should try to read my {LF}fortune to see.
You know that Max, {LF}over at Herman's place? {LF}I wonder if he likes anyone right now.
I have no idea.
Why bother with reading a fortune?{LF}Maybe I should just go ask him myself.
I'm not a big fan of the{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is there something you don't like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm not a big fan of the{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is there something you don't like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm not a big fan of the{LF}＠アイテム０＠.{LF}Is there something you don't like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you want to do in the future?
I haven't decided yet.{LF}For now, I'm just happy poking {LF}around in the dirt on my farm.
I want to become a famous{LF}fortune-teller.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you want to do in the future?
I haven't decided yet.{LF}For now, I'm just happy poking {LF}around in the dirt on my farm.
Myself, I want to become a famous{LF}fortune-teller.
I think my mother always wanted {LF}me to become a doctor, though.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you want to do in the future?
I haven't decided yet.{LF}For now, I'm just happy poking {LF}around in the dirt on my farm.
I want to become a famous {LF}fortune-teller.
That's why I'm going to leave{LF}this town someday.
I know it's kind of a strange question,{LF}but do you think I've put on some weight{LF}lately?
No, you're the same as always.
Have you been eating too much?
Hm... Really?
How did you know?{LF}You might be a better fortune-teller{LF}than I am, ＠カイル＠＠.
I know it's kind of a strange question,{LF}but do you think I've put on some {LF}weight lately?
No, you're the same as always.
Well, now that you mention it...
That's good.
It's because fortune-tellers have to {LF}work sitting down all day.{LF}I don't know what to do about it.
I know it's kind of a strange question,{LF}but do you think I've put on some weight{LF}lately?
No, you're the same as always.
Well, now that you mention it...
Have you been skipping dinner?
Whew.{LF}That's a relief.
Really?{LF}I think it's because fortune-tellers{LF}have to work sitting down all day.{LF}I haven't been getting much exercise.
Skipping dinner, huh?{LF}That's rough.
Can I tell you something?{LF}Ceci and Mana are having a fight.
What happened?
It's just a little misunderstanding.{LF}It's hard seeing friends fight,{LF}isn't it?{LF}I hope they'll make up soon.
It would be nice if you could{LF}help them work it out.
Yeah.
Can I tell you something?{LF}I had a fight with Mana.
What happened?
She said my fortunes wouldn't come true!{LF}That's not something to joke about.
But she was just joking, right?{LF}Your friendship is more{LF}important than that.
I know that.{LF}You're right, I should{LF}make up with her.
Can I tell you something?{LF}I had a fight with Ceci and Mana.
What happened?
We usually have a good time{LF}talking together, but this time{LF}we all must have just been {LF}in a bad mood.
Really?{LF}I think it would be best if{LF}you all made up quickly.
Yeah, I think so too.
Hey, um...{LF}Have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
Not yet.
Sure, I have.
Don't you think being married {LF}would be fun, ＠カイル＠＠?
I see.
Really?{LF}Who would you marry?{LF}No, wait! I'll see if it's{LF}in your fortune!
Hey, um...{LF}Have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
Not yet.
Sure, I have.
I see.{LF}Well, you're still a child.
Really?{LF}Who would you marry?{LF}No, wait! I'll see if it's{LF}in your fortune!
Hey, um...{LF}Have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
Not yet.
Sure, I have.
I see.{LF}Well, you should get to bed.
Really?{LF}Who would you marry?{LF}No, wait! I'll read your fortune{LF}and tell you who to marry!
Y-You really don't have to...
I started reading fortunes in order to{LF}make someone I liked like me back.{LF}I guess that's not the best reason.
No...{LF}I think that's a perfectly good reason.
Really?{LF}That makes me feel better.
If my fortunes don't look like they are{LF}going to come true, I'll do something to{LF}help them come true.{LF}Is that strange?
Well, it is a little unusual.
I thought so.
My mother objects to me to being a{LF}fortune-teller.{LF}I don't know what to do about it.
I think that if a person wants to be{LF}happy, they need to do what they want to{LF}do themselves.
Yes... I think so too.{LF}Thank you.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't know about it.
I've heard about it.
I hear all of the monsters you find{LF}around here all come from the Forest of{LF}Beginnings in a parallel word.
Oh, you already knew.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't know about it.
I've heard about it.
It's supposed to be where{LF}all the monsters live.{LF}I wonder what kind of a place{LF}that would be.
Oh, I didn't think you knew yet.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't know about it.
I've heard about it.
It's supposed to be where{LF}all the monsters live.{LF}I wonder what would happen{LF}if a human went there.
Oh, so you know already.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you satisfied with this town?
I wish I had my own place{LF}to do my fortune-telling.{LF}I wonder if Byron would{LF}build one for me.
Or Herman, I guess.{LF}But even rich people{LF}can still be stingy.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you satisfied with this town?
I wish I had my own place{LF}to do my fortune-telling.{LF}It's hot having to stand{LF}outside on the pier.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you satisfied with this town?
Yeah, I guess.
Are you, Alicia?
So some people can be {LF}completely satisfied.{LF}That's really something.
I wish people would be more{LF}interested in fortune-telling.{LF}I guess that I'm {LF}speaking in general, though.
Farming is like living as {LF}one with the earth.{LF}Isn't that incredible?
The sun is hot today.{LF}It must be nice to work {LF}with sweat on your forehead.
It looks like the sun has set.{LF}Are you done working today?
Yeah, I thought I'd finish it up.
Farming is like living as one with {LF}the earth. You're really something,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I don't think I could do it.
Don't sell yourself short.{LF}I couldn't be a fortune-teller {LF}like you, either.
Really?{LF}That's nice of you to say.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
They're legendary dragons,{LF}but my readings don't give{LF}me any sign of what they look like.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
Wouldn't it be fun if one{LF}appeared in my crystal ball?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
To think that something could{LF}have the power to destroy the{LF}entire world.{LF}Scary, isn't it?
Hey...＠カイル＠＠...
What is it?
I'm glad that we're friends,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad too.
I predicted that we'd be friends the{LF}day I met you!{LF}I'm really glad that prediction came{LF}true!
Hey...＠カイル＠＠...
What is it?
I'm glad that we're friends,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad too.
I predicted that we'd be friends the{LF}day I met you!{LF}I'm really glad that prediction came{LF}true!
Hey...＠カイル＠＠...
What is it?
I'm glad that we're friends,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad too.
It's just like I predicted!{LF}I wonder if my prediction helped us{LF}us become friends...
How are you doing, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Would you like me to read your fortune?{LF}
It must be nice being young.{LF}You don't seem to have any worries.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you should go out and play!{LF}That's the best thing for a child.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I don't need to read my fortune to know{LF}that I love you most of all.
Your father was a very fine man,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. You should be{LF}proud of him.
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}It's unusual for you to come here.
Summer is always so hot.{LF}Don't you think so, ＠アルス＠＠?
I wonder why I never was {LF}able to get married.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, what do you think?
Brr... It's cold.{LF}I don't want to leave my room {LF}when it's this cold out.
Be careful out there, ＠アルス＠＠.
It's summer.{LF}You should go outside and play,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Don't just sit around inside,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Go out and play with your friends.
You should go outside, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You could go have a snowball fight.
Isn't spring nice, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I think it's my favorite season.
Are you keeping up with your studies,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Would you like me to do a reading{LF}to see what questions are on your{LF}next test?
I wonder why my readings {LF}don't come true more often.{LF}What do you think, ＠アルス＠＠?
Was it cold outside, ＠アルス＠＠?
How can I become {LF}a better fortune-teller?
When it's this hot outside, {LF}my readings aren't as accurate.
I wonder if anyone would be{LF}interested in food readings.
It's hard doing my fortune-telling{LF}out in the cold.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Would you like to know your fortune?
I'd like to talk.
Tell me my fortune.
Never mind.
Oh, really?
I thought fortune-telling {LF}would earn me more money.
Weather Reading.
Location Reading.
Love Reading.
Never mind.
Tomorrow's weather.
I want it to be clear tomorrow.
I want it to be rainy tomorrow.
Never mind.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be sunny.
That'll be 10G.
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be rainy.
That'll be 10G.
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be snowy.
That'll be 10G.
I can see it.{LF}Tomorrow will be stormy.
That'll be 10G.
That's a little more difficult.{LF}But if you pay me 200G,{LF}I'll do my best.

Cancel
La-lee-loo-la!{LF}La-lee-loo-la!
I've done it.{LF}Tomorrow is definitely {LF}going to be sunny now.
That's a tough one.{LF}But if you pay me 2,000G,{LF}I'll give it a try.
Pay

Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
I've done it.{LF}Tomorrow is definitely{LF}going to be rainy now.
Thank you!{LF}Come back again, okay?
You don't have enough money!{LF}I'll do it for you just this once,{LF}but next time you're on your own.

Never mind.
Okay, I'll give you a location reading!
Hollyhalla! Jami-la-la!{LF}Wahala!!!
Heh heh heh.{LF}I can see it! I've spotted you now!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠, and
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
＠キャラ０＠ is in{LF}＠マップ０＠,
＠キャラ１＠ is in{LF}＠マップ１＠, and
＠キャラ２＠ is in{LF}＠マップ２＠.{LF}No doubt about it!
That'll be 20G.
Sim sala bim! Sim sim sim{LF}sala bim!
Cammy seems quite interested in you.
Well, you know how Sera is...{LF}But still, it seems she likes you.
Serena likes you too, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}They're twins, all right.
Leann also likes you, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're sure popular!
It doesn't look like anyone{LF}likes you right now.{LF}Don't let it get you down.
Roy seems quite interested in you.
It looks like Orland{LF}has a secret crush on you.
Leonel is cute, don't you think?
But that's beside the point.{LF}Leonel seems to like you.
I don't think ＠アルス＠＠'s interested in {LF}anyone right now. Cheer up. You never {LF}know what the future might bring.
That'll be 20G.
Oh, okay.
Nothing like a nice bath to get your {LF}energy back.
You kids better take a bath every {LF}day, knowing how much you sweat.
Can't beat a long bath for those long {LF}autumn nights.
Watch you don't catch a cold after you {LF}get out, ＠アルス＠＠, this being winter {LF}and all.
I see you're just as chipper as ever, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
According to my reading, ＠アルス＠＠, {LF}you've been living dangerously lately.
Have you made a lot of friends, {LF}＠アルス＠＠? {LF}Just be sure to keep them.
You're starting to look like a {LF}real warrior, ＠アルス＠＠. 
According to my reading, the town {LF}has a bright future ahead of it. {LF}A future of peace.
I always knew your dad would return. {LF}My reading said so, anyway.
So, ＠カイル＠＠'s come home. Just {LF}like my fortune predicted.
It's so peaceful here. Don't you think {LF}so, ＠アルス＠＠?
I wonder what I could do to improve {LF}the accuracy of my readings...
My readings are a lot more accurate {LF}now, don't you think?
Ah, thank you! I asked Douglas for{LF}this. I thought it could brighten up{LF}the clinic. Thanks for bringing it{LF}over.
Be sure to thank Douglas for me, {LF}will you?
This for me?
Why, thank you. {LF}This is just what I needed.
Don't mention it.
It's not much, but here. {LF}I want to give you this in return.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
If anything else comes up, I'll post it {LF}on the bulletin board.
Is this for me?
Are you giving this to me? Wow, {LF}thanks! I love it!
Actually, I don't really like these. Sorry.
Hey, thanks. I love these.
I'm actually not a fan of these. Sorry.
This is for me? Thanks.
I can't wait to try it.
Is this for me? Thanks.
I can't wait to drink it.
I really like these, but I would've {LF}preferred it for my birthday.
Thanks. Today's my birthday, actually. {LF}A ＠アイテム９＠... I can't believe it!
I couldn't accept any more than this.
I love this, but I wish I'd gotten {LF}it for my birthday instead.
Thanks. Today's my birthday, actually. {LF}A ＠アイテム９＠... I can't believe it!
I can't keep accepting these like this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Really?
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Really?
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠. Are you feeling{LF}under the weather at all? If so,{LF}talk to my mom, and she'll fix{LF}you right up.
It gets awfully hot in summer. You {LF}need to take extra care of yourself in {LF}this heat.
I love to watch the leaves turn color{LF}in the fall. 
Watch you don't catch cold in this {LF}weather.
It's not often I see you up here. Is {LF}there something I can do for you?
I want to be the kind of person who {LF}helps out his fellow man. That's not {LF}too high-falutin', is it?
I wish Mom and Sis wouldn't come {LF}down on me so hard all the time.
Sure has gotten cold lately, huh?
Oh, hi, ＠カイル＠＠. You know, a bath {LF}can be good for what ails ya.
A cold bath's just the kind of thing {LF}you want on a day like this, isn't it?
I really love taking baths. They're so {LF}relaxing.
A nice warm bath is the best in{LF}a cold winter, huh?
Something about the church just {LF}appeals to me. I guess I find it {LF}soothing.
It gets really hot in the church during {LF}summer.
The images of autumn go with the {LF}church better than any other season, {LF}don't you think?
I like the quiet atmosphere you find in {LF}the church in winter.
Good day to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, Ray. Oh, I see you and {LF}Rosalind are hanging out together.
Yes. And what is so noteworthy about{LF}that?
Oh, uh...
Good day to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, Ray. Another scorcher {LF}today, huh?
Well, what else can we expect in {LF}summer?
Good day to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, Ray. Nice this time of {LF}year, isn't it?
Sure is. I know everything tastes{LF}better in fall, but be careful {LF}you don't eat too much.
Ha ha, I won't.
The only man I know who can eat {LF}whatever he wants is my father. He's {LF}always as healthy as a horse.
Good day to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, Ray. Really cold these {LF}days, isn't it?
I'm surprised you're so lightly {LF}dressed, ＠カイル＠＠.
Yeah, guess you could say that, heh. 
It's nice taking a stroll about the {LF}town every now and then, isn't it?
Sometimes it's nice just standing {LF}around too.
You like taking walks, ＠カイル＠＠?
Some exercise is essential to {LF}staying healthy.
It's really cold these days, huh? Not {LF}the best time of year for walks, heh.
Monsters are crawling all over up {LF}ahead. I've never gone in there {LF}myself before.
Promise me you'll be careful, okay? {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}is up ahead.
Good day. I believe this is{LF}the first time we've met.
How do you do? The name's{LF}＠カイル＠＠. 
I'm Ray. Nice to meet you.
Same here.
My mom's a doctor. If you're ever{LF}feeling sick, stop by our house.
Thanks. That's good to know.
By the way, my sister's a fortune-{LF}teller. She's still learning, but maybe {LF}you could humor her once in a while.
Heh, sure thing!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good day.
Good day.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, good day.
Good day.
Oh, good evening.
Good evening.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, Ray.
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, Ray.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, Ray.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Are you doing well?
Good morning, Ray!{LF}I'm good. Thanks!
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}You doing okay?
Good day. I'm just fine.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠. How you {LF}doing?
Good evening. Doing just fine.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking quite well as usual.
Well, thank you.
Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking quite well as usual.
Well, thank you.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking quite well as usual.
Well, thank you.
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.
Evening, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Be sure to get to bed early, okay?
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Here's to the next one!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Flower Festival. {LF}You like cherry blossoms, ＠カイル＠＠?
Today's the Flower Festival. {LF}You like cherry blossoms, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Eating Contest. What's {LF}your favorite thing to eat?
Wow, ＠カイル＠＠! I can't believe you {LF}won the Eating Contest.
That's too bad about the contest. {LF}There's always next year, though.
Today's the Eating Contest. You gonna {LF}take part in it, ＠アルス＠＠?
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠! I can't believe {LF}you won the Eating Contest.
The food was delicious.
It's the start of swimming season.{LF}How are you at swimming, ＠カイル＠＠?
Swimming season starts today. Be sure{LF}to stretch before you go in the water.
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}I can't remember, do you own any {LF}monsters, ＠カイル＠＠?
That was amazing, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Congratulations!
That's too bad about the contest. {LF}Better luck next year!
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}You going to compete, ＠アルス＠＠?
You're pretty good, ＠アルス＠＠!
Sorry to hear you didn't win.
Today's the Dance Festival. Have you {LF}been looking forward to it,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Sure. I guess so. What about you, Ray? {LF}You gonna ask someone?
Ummm... (I'd like to ask Rosalind, but{LF}I haven't worked up the courage...)
Today's the Dance Festival. You {LF}planning on inviting anyone, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Fishing Contest. Are you {LF}going to compete, ＠カイル＠＠?
You're pretty good at fishing, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I wish I were that good.
Sorry to hear about the contest. {LF}Hope you do better next time!
Today's the Big Cook-Off. You been {LF}helping out your mother in the kitchen, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I bet you won because of all {LF}the practice you get helping {LF}your mother, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was too bad about the contest.
Today's the Adventure Contest. I'm {LF}not so good at this one... Are you {LF}going to enter, ＠カイル＠＠?
That was amazing, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I'm nowhere near as good as you.
Too bad, ＠カイル＠＠. You were really {LF}close.
Today's the Adventure Contest. Are {LF}you going to try your luck, ＠アルス＠＠?
Congrats, ＠アルス＠＠. Just be careful {LF}you don't overdo it, though.
Well, least you didn't get injured.
Today's the Harvest Festival. This is {LF}probably my favorite festival.
Today's the Harvest Festival. It's a nice {LF}get-together, isn't it?
Today's the Monster Contest. Have {LF}you raised some good ones?
That was something else, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}You blew me away.
Sorry to hear about the contest. {LF}You'll be back next time, though, {LF}right?
Today's the Monster Contest. You {LF}have any favorite monsters, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Dang, ＠アルス＠＠, you're really good {LF}with monsters.
Guess you lost, huh...
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. I {LF}wonder who Rosalind's going with...
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}Are you going with someone, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
It's hard for you kids to really{LF}appreciate this festival at{LF}your age, though.
Today's the Mining Contest. {LF}You like this type of thing, {LF}don't you, ＠カイル＠＠? {LF}I'm no good at it, though.
I knew you'd win, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I just knew it!
I was sure you'd win, ＠カイル＠＠...
Today's the Mining Contest. Are you {LF}going to take part in it, ＠アルス＠＠?
That was great, ＠アルス＠＠! I'm {LF}impressed.
Well, you win some, you lose some, {LF}eh?
Today's the last day of the year. Let's {LF}you and me work to make the next {LF}one even better, ＠カイル＠＠.
Today's the last day of the year. Hope {LF}to see you plenty in the next one, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Oh, you checked out the {LF}bulletin board, did you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
Would you mind looking for a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me?
They grow wild around here,{LF}so you might find them in your{LF}field.
Well, that doesn't sound too hard.
I'm also certain you'll find them in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
Okay.
See if you could find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me.
You can find some out in the wild in {LF}the fields. I'm sure you'll find them {LF}in ＠マップ９＠.
Have you found a ＠アイテム９＠ yet? If {LF}you do, be sure to give it to me, okay?
You're a good guy, ＠カイル＠＠.
Say, you think you could help me {LF}out, ＠カイル＠＠?
What's the matter?
You see, my sister and mother are {LF}kind of having an argument. {LF}Nothing unusual for them, but still.
I was wondering if you might be able {LF}to defuse the situation. Could you go {LF}see what's going on with them?
I doubt they'd tell me what's really {LF}going on.
Please, ＠カイル＠＠, you're the only {LF}one I could ask.
Sure thing.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Go see what's going on with them, {LF}will you?
How'd it go?
Fine. It seems Alicia eating {LF}your mother's ＠アイテム９＠ {LF}is what set the whole thing off.
Figures. That's Mom's favorite.
She's made it for us since we were {LF}little. Nothing beats Mom's cooking.
I see. Must be nice.
Yeah. Anyway, thanks, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}You were a big help.
No problem. Your family is really...{LF}interesting, Ray.
Yeah, don't I know it. Well, at least{LF}it's never dull, right?{LF}Thanks again.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I'm glad there are {LF}people like you around.
Oh, you're here, ＠カイル＠＠.
What did you want to see me about?
I want to become a doctor when I'm {LF}older, but I'm thinking I should study {LF}first aid, too.
Any injuries incurred in battles with {LF}monsters would serve as good {LF}experience for me.
So...you want me to get injured on {LF}purpose?
Oh, no, you don't have to get {LF}yourself injured. I'd just like to see {LF}a real battle for myself.
Please, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you're the only {LF}one I could ask to do this.
Okay.
Thanks. How about taking on a {LF}Pomme Pomme in {LF}＠マップ９＠?
The monsters that appear in any given {LF}place change when it's nighttime.
Pomme Pomme appear in the day. {LF}After 6 o'clock at night, different {LF}monsters will appear instead.
Got it.
I'll be waiting for you there.
You don't think there's anything {LF}wrong with what I want to do, do you?
No, it's perfectly understandable.
Thanks.{LF}So, ＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll be waiting.
And remember, it's Pomme Pomme {LF}you want to fight.
I really appreciate your help.
I owe you one, ＠カイル＠＠. It's good {LF}to know there are guys like you out {LF}there.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. Do you think you {LF}could go take this medicine to Barrett{LF}for me?
To Barrett? Is he okay?
Actually, it isn't for Barrett.{LF}It's for his father, Byron.
Uh oh. So Byron is the one who's sick?
No no, Byron's fine, too. This is just {LF}some vitamins. Something to keep him{LF}in good health.
I see. So then why is Barrett getting{LF}it for Byron?
Well, to be honest, Barrett worries{LF}about his dad.
After all, Byron's the mayor. He's {LF}always busy with work. That'll {LF}eventually take its toll on his body.
Barrett's a bit of a quiet guy. And {LF}when he does talk, he doesn't have {LF}a way with words. I don't think he {LF}and his old man get on well.
I know Barrett. He's my friend. {LF}He's a good guy.
He just...isn't good at letting his {LF}feelings show. That's why he comes {LF}off a little rude.
Barrett asked that I give this {LF}＠アイテム９＠ to my mother.
I see.
＠カイル＠＠, the reason I asked you {LF}was because I wanted you and {LF}Barrett to become friends.
I figure it'll take some time, but the {LF}best way to start is to make you {LF}guys talk to one another.
Okay. I'll go talk to Barrett.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Whoops, looks like your backpack's {LF}full. Can you get rid of something for {LF}me?
Will you go give this ＠アイテム９＠ to {LF}Barrett for me?
How'd it go?
Well, I gave him the ＠アイテム９＠, but {LF}we didn't really talk much.
I see. Well, thanks anyway.
It's not much, but take this in return.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
See if you can get a chance to get {LF}to know Barrett a little more, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll try.
You're kind of a strange guy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Everyone just opens up to {LF}you.
Have you noticed anything unusual {LF}lately, Ray? I'm going around {LF}patrolling to see if everything's okay.
Anything unusual? Everything's {LF}always fine around here.
I thought I'd test you with some{LF}exercise today, ＠アルス＠＠.
Test?
Test?
Ha ha! It's nothing to worry about! It's {LF}pretty easy. It'll be fun!
When I say go, press the A Button as fast{LF}as you can. Got it?
I'll give it my best shot!
I'll give it my best shot!
Okay, here we go. Ready...go! {LF}(Hit the A Button!)
Stop!
Your score is ＠数字０＠ points.
You probably could have done {LF}better than that...
Not bad, not bad. I'm sure you could {LF}do better, though.
That was pretty good! That's a great {LF}score, actually!
Wow! I don't believe it! That's better {LF}than most adults!
That was almost inhuman! You're almost{LF}like a master at this! Great job,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Try again.
Stop.
Good luck, ＠アルス＠＠!
That's enough for the test. Here's a {LF}reward for participating.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I also thought I'd give you this{LF}＠アイテム９＠. It should come in{LF}handy!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Oh, your backpack's full. You'll {LF}need to get rid of something first.
Spring's such a nice season. Perfect {LF}for dreaming the days away.
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival. {LF}I love the cherry blossoms.
That was a pretty big earthquake we {LF}had yesterday.
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest. {LF}Rosalind said her dad's {LF}looking forward to it.
Tomorrow's the start of swimming{LF}season. You like to swim,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm not so good at it, ha ha.
Tomorrow's the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. I don't own any monsters, {LF}so I can't compete.
Another earthquake! {LF}I hope Rosalind's okay.
It's hot today, isn't it?{LF}But summer just wouldn't be {LF}summer if it wasn't.
Tomorrow's the Dance Festival. Still {LF}can't make up my mind if I should {LF}invite somebody or not... 
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest. {LF}That's always fun.
Why don't you try tomorrow's {LF}Adventure Contest, ＠カイル＠＠? {LF}I bet you would be pretty good.
That was another earthquake we {LF}had. At least nobody got hurt.
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival. It's {LF}great how we're able to grow our own {LF}food like this. All thanks to Mother {LF}Earth.
Autumn's really settled in, huh? It's {LF}one of my favorite times of the year.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest. {LF}Do you own any monsters, ＠カイル＠＠?
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}The day when you make a wish under {LF}the stars with someone. Anyone you {LF}plan on inviting, ＠カイル＠＠?
Mornings and evenings sure are cold {LF}now, huh? Make sure you don't catch {LF}cold or anything.
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest. {LF}One time I accidentally hit my foot {LF}with a hammer. It got really{LF}sore, ha ha.
Another earthquake again. If they keep {LF}happening this often, I might have to {LF}set up an emergency plan.
Tomorrow's the last day of the year. {LF}You have a good year, ＠カイル＠＠?
This is my favorite season, when all {LF}the cherry blossoms are out. What's {LF}your favorite season, ＠アルス＠＠?
Summer's not such a great time to be {LF}outside a lot, is it?
I like autumn. I find I can rediscover {LF}who I am amid the stillness.
Someone as young as you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠, doesn't need to worry {LF}about that, though.
Winter always chills me right down to {LF}my bones. What about you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You like Alvarna, ＠カイル＠＠? {LF}I definitely like it here.
I don't think my sister likes it much, {LF}though.
So, how do you like Alvarna,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Look, it's already dark. Night comes {LF}up on you fast this time of year.
I always feel best in the morning. {LF}What about you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Morning's the best time of the day to {LF}work the field.
Everyone heads back home at night {LF}around these parts.
I like ＠アイテム０＠.
I like ＠アイテム０＠. What about you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I like ＠アイテム０＠. What do you think {LF}of it, ＠カイル＠＠?
You made some friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm pretty good friends with Max.
You made some friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm pretty good friends with Max.
The people in Herman's house are a {LF}little quirky, but they're all nice.
You made some friends yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm pretty good friends with Max.
You wouldn't think Rosalind and Max {LF}are Herman's kids, would you?
Herman acts pretty different from {LF}most people. Sometimes I think{LF}he's actually not human.
This village is part of Norad, but you {LF}wouldn't think that, because it's in {LF}the middle of nowhere.
They say mankind first appeared in {LF}Norad, though no one knows for sure.
I'd like to go check out Norad's capital {LF}once. I hear their medicine's pretty {LF}advanced, for one thing.
You like farming?
There's a lot of different jobs in the {LF}world to pick from, huh? I want to {LF}become a doctor, but I'm not sure if {LF}that's everything I'd like to do.
Whatever you do, you'll have fun and {LF}earn people's respect if you {LF}pour your heart into it. 
I really like ＠アイテム０＠.
I really like ＠アイテム０＠. Gets me {LF}excited just thinking about it!
I really like ＠アイテム０＠. What about {LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Are you interested in fashion at all, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not really, no.
Me either. Rosalind's always trying to {LF}get me to pay more attention to how I {LF}dress. I dunno what to do.
Are you interested in fashion at all, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not really, no.
I was just thinking how cool your {LF}outfit looks.
Are you interested in fashion at all, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not really, no.
Something like what Max has on {LF}would suit a girl pretty well, huh?
Hey, don't look at me.
You heard the story about a ghost {LF}walking in front of the clinic lately?
I wonder who goes around spreading {LF}that stuff?
You heard the story about a ghost {LF}walking in front of the clinic lately?
Those stories are usually a load of {LF}baloney.
You heard the story about a ghost {LF}walking in front of the clinic lately?
I get the feeling my sister's the one {LF}behind it.
The only thing I can't stand is {LF}＠アイテム０＠.
The only thing I can't stand is {LF}＠アイテム０＠.
The only thing I can't stand is {LF}＠アイテム０＠. Is there anything you {LF}don't like, ＠カイル＠＠?
Did you know I was born on {LF}the 8th of Autumn?
Actually, I was born on{LF}the 8th of Autumn.
I was born on the the 8th of Autumn. {LF}Not like that matters to you, {LF}though, heh.
Say, is there anyone you like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? Umm...I dunno...What about {LF}you, Ray?
Me? Umm...I dunno either... 
Say, is there anyone you like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? Umm...I dunno...What about {LF}you, Ray?
Me? Umm...I dunno either...Heh.
Say, is there anyone you like, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? Umm...I dunno...What about {LF}you, Ray?
Me? Umm...I dunno either... 
It wouldn't be Rosalind, would it?
What?! What makes you say that?
Kids are really cute, aren't they? {LF}I like kids.
I wish there were more people {LF}around here.
You ever had your fortune told by my {LF}sister?
She's usually way off with most {LF}things, but her weather forecasts are {LF}spot on.
Is there anyone Rosalind likes?
I've no idea.
Yeah, guess you can't read {LF}people's minds.
I know Rosalind comes off as {LF}stuck-up, but she's a nice person {LF}deep down.
Hard to believe Rosalind's father is {LF}Herman, huh?
I don't like ＠アイテム０＠.
I hate ＠アイテム０＠. I couldn't tell you {LF}why, I just do.
I'm not a big fan of ＠アイテム０＠.
What do you plan to do with yourself {LF}in the future, ＠カイル＠＠?
I still haven't decided. I'm having fun {LF}just looking after the land right now.
I want to be a doctor when I'm older.
What do you plan to do with yourself {LF}in the future, ＠カイル＠＠?
I still haven't decided. I'm having fun {LF}just looking after the land right now.
I want to be a doctor when I'm older. I {LF}want to do something that helps people.
What do you plan to do with yourself {LF}in the future, ＠カイル＠＠?
I still haven't decided. I'm having fun {LF}just looking after the land right now.
I want to become a doctor. Maybe it's {LF}because of my mom.
You need to have good stamina if you {LF}want to be a doctor. Maybe I should {LF}exercise more?
You look pretty strong, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}What do you do for exercise?
Farming must make you that way {LF}over time, huh?
I wish we had a library around here. {LF}I want to be able to study more.
You like books, ＠カイル＠＠? I love {LF}books.
I can't believe we don't have a library {LF}around here.
I'd be able to study more if we had a {LF}library.
Have you thought about getting married, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yeah.
I see. Well, I suppose there's no rush.
Really? That's a mature thing for {LF}someone your age to be thinking {LF}about.
Have you thought about getting married, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yeah.
I see.
Really? So...to who?
Have you thought about getting married, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yeah.
I see. That's only natural.
Really?! To who? You...you're not{LF}thinking about Rosalind, are you?
I wonder why we fall in love, anyway.
You ever fallen in love with someone, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You ever thought about someone so {LF}much you couldn't sleep at night?
You know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No.
Yeah.
That's where all monsters come from. {LF}So they say, anyway.
Oh, you know about it? I shoulda {LF}guessed.
You know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No.
Yeah.
When you defeat a monster, it's sent{LF}there. They're teleported there by{LF}some strange magic...
You really know a lot.
You know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No.
Yeah.
You ever wonder if there are other {LF}worlds apart from ours? Or maybe {LF}an underground world?
I thought you might, ＠カイル＠＠.
How do you think we could make the {LF}town better than it is?
I want to help improve the town any {LF}way I can.
I wish we could make this place more {LF}enjoyable for everyone living here.
You seem like you've gotten used to {LF}this place, ＠カイル＠＠.
You know, I feel like we've been {LF}friends for years, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad we became friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. That's the honest truth.
You know about the Elder Dragons, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They're ancient, powerful dragons. I've{LF}heard that one has appeared around here {LF}before. I'd sure like to see one!
You know about the Elder Dragon, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
If we could somehow apply the {LF}dragon's life force to healing spells, {LF}I'm sure we could come up {LF}with all sorts of new medicines.
You know about the Elder Dragon, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They say its power could rival that of{LF}man's mightiest army.
I really am happy we're friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad you and I are friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Me too.
You mean it?{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!
I think it's great how you and I{LF}have become friends, ＠カイル＠＠.
You always take the time to listen to {LF}me... I hope we'll always be friends.
Of course we will.
Are you feeling okay, ＠アルス＠＠?
Have you made any friends, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
You're not going anywhere dangerous, {LF}are you, ＠アルス＠＠? Like the{LF}monster-infested areas outside town?
Be sure to have some fun and play {LF}every day, ＠アルス＠＠.
You're the spitting image of your {LF}father, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}He was a great man.
What can I do for you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Be sure to drink plenty of water in {LF}summer, you hear?
Autumn's a great season for playing {LF}outdoors.
Don't shut yourself inside {LF}all the time just 'cause it's cold.
What can I do for you today?
I want to talk.
I feel a little sick.
I want to buy something.
I'd like a ＠アイテム２＠.
If you ever feel under the weather, {LF}don't hesitate to stop on by, okay?
The best place to play in the summer {LF}is under the trees in the shade.
Be careful you don't eat too much {LF}in autumn.
It's easier to catch a cold when {LF}the temperature drops. Be careful,{LF}okay?
All right, let me take a look at you. {LF}Take a deep breath, then exhale...
Hmm, it looks like you've been {LF}poisoned.
Your HP will continue to decrease {LF}for a period of time. Not a good thing {LF}at all, no sir.
Hmm, it seems you've been paralyzed.
You won't be able to run, so it'll take {LF}you longer to get around.
Hmm, you've been sealed... {LF}You don't want that.
You won't be able to use magic or {LF}rune abilities.
Hmm, you look exhausted.
Staying up till 3 in the morning will {LF}tire you out. This doubles your rune {LF}consumption. Not good, not good at {LF}all.
You're definitely sick, all right.
Staying up till 3 in the morning will {LF}tire you out.
Staying up till 3 in the morning when {LF}you're tired will get you sick.
When you're sick, your RP {LF}consumption triples. You can't let {LF}that happen.
Okay, that wraps that up. You're {LF}going to be fine in no time.
All right, all done. Be sure to take {LF}care of yourself. Oh, that'll be 100G.
Thank you. You know, there's {LF}nothing wrong with wanting to {LF}succeed in life, but you need to know {LF}when too much is too much.
You're fine! You've got nothing to{LF}worry about!
Oh, it seems you're a little short on {LF}money.
I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry.
It's okay. This one's on the house. {LF}Just don't tell anyone, okay?
Thanks!
Thanks!
You'll need ＠数字０＠ ＠アイテム０＠S,{LF}＠数字１＠ ＠アイテム１＠, and ＠数字２＠G.
I see you've got everything. Hold on {LF}just a minute...
There we go!
You got: ＠アイテム２＠!
Oh, it seems you're a little short on {LF}money.
Oh, it seems you're a little short on {LF}herbs.
Oh, it doesn't look like you have any {LF}empty bottles.
It's not often we see you at church.
Father Gordon's sermons are pretty {LF}interesting affairs.
Remember to be on your best {LF}behavior. Gordon may claim to be a{LF}pacifist, but if you interrupt him,{LF}he'll put you in a headlock.
We should all remember to be thankful{LF}for what we have.
Well hello, ＠アルス＠＠. What brings {LF}you here?
Herman's house is always nice and {LF}cool, even in summer.
Big houses are great for playing {LF}around in.
The bigger a house, the colder it gets {LF}in winter.
Baths are good for your health.
Hot water drains your body's energy. {LF}Don't stay in for too long.
The best thing for your body is a bath {LF}in lukewarm water.
Be sure to dry yourself completely {LF}when you come out. You'll catch {LF}cold in winter if you're not careful.
If I don't go out and walk around {LF}town every so often, {LF}I end up getting sick.
Do you like summer, ＠アルス＠＠?
What does autumn remind you of, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Taking a walk in winter can be{LF}quite cold. I wouldn't recommend{LF}it, unless you're wearing the{LF}right clothes.
There's nothing wrong with having fun, {LF}＠アルス＠＠, but just make sure you {LF}don't hurt yourself, okay?
Do you play outside of town? It can be {LF}pretty dangerous out there, so I {LF}wouldn't do it too often if I were you.
There's nothing wrong with having fun {LF}when you're a kid, but just make sure {LF}you don't hurt yourself.
You look like you've put on some{LF}muscle lately, ＠アルス＠＠. It's not {LF}good to bulk up too much when you're {LF}a kid, though.
I heard you've been spending a lot of {LF}time studying lately, ＠アルス＠＠.
I heard ＠カイル＠＠'s back! That's great {LF}news, huh, ＠アルス＠＠?
It's hard work becoming a doctor. I {LF}respect my mom for what she's {LF}accomplished.
If you ever feel sick or hurt yourself, {LF}don't hesitate to stop by.
This is it!
It's it!
So, uh, what am I supposed to{LF}do with this?
So, uh, what am I supposed to{LF}do with this?
Propose to us!
Yeah, propose to us, ＠アルス＠＠!
What?! P-Propose? You mean like,{LF}getting married?
What?! P-Propose? You mean like,{LF}getting married?
Yeah! Grownups propose toast with{LF}fancy glasses! Then they get married{LF}and have, uh, toast, I think!
Yay! I want to get married and{LF}have some toast!
B-But we're still just kids!
Toast? Uh, I don't know if{LF}that's quite right...
Don't you like Sera?
Don't you like Serena?
No, I do, but... 
No, I do, but... 
Okay then!
No problem!
But... 
But... 
To the church!
Yes! You need to propose toast to{LF}us!{LF}
＠アルス＠＠, do you take Sera and {LF}Serena to be your wives, promising to {LF}love and honor them, in sickness and {LF}in health...
For as long as you...erm, all shall{LF}live?
Uh... Well... 
Uh... Well... 
Ga ha ha! Ya can't make vows at {LF}your age!
We're only pretending, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Do it right!
Just pretend!
What? We're only pretending?
What? We're only pretending?
Of course, what did you think we {LF}were doing?
Yeah!
Oh, okay!
Oh, okay!
Kids and their games {LF}these days...Ha ha ha!
Well, we're pretending about the{LF}marriage! We still want toast!
Yay! Toast!
I want toast with marmalade!
Me too!
No! I called it first!
No fair!
Look, you two... 
Look, you two... 
Ga ha ha! I don't think they{LF}understand what being married{LF}means!
Marriage isn't about toast! It's{LF}about vows! Honor! Promises!
Marriage isn't about toast! It's{LF}about vows! Honor! Promises!
Really?
Aw, boo! I wanted some toast!
Well, let's just ask Mom and{LF}Dad to make us some marmalade{LF}toast when we get home!
Yay! That's a good idea!
Well, this was fun anyway! And I{LF}learned that marriage isn't about{LF}toast! It's about, uh, honor and{LF}vows, or something!
Yay! Vows!
Is this for me? Let's see how it tastes.
I want half!
This is great! Thanks.
I want some more.
Is this for me? Let's see how it tastes.
I want half!
This is great! Thanks. You're not so {LF}bad after all, ＠アルス＠＠.
Not bad at all, ＠アルス＠＠.
Thanks! This is my favorite.
Thanks! This my favorite too.
Sorry, but I don't really like that.
Actually, I hate it.
I love that, but maybe you could save {LF}it for my birthday?
Birthdays are special.
Thanks, today's our birthday. {LF}Wow, a ＠アイテム９＠... {LF}I'm so happy!
So happy!
That's nice of you, but I only need one {LF}present on my birthday.
Getting too many presents {LF}takes away from the meaning.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me?
For me?!
I love holidays!
I just wanna curl up with my books!
Mondays are always so languid.
What does "languid" mean?
I'm not sure, but I hear grown-ups {LF}use it sometimes.
Yeah!
I wanna exercise. The school doesn't {LF}have a field we can play on or {LF}anything.
I just wanna curl up with my books!
Wednesday means it's the middle of {LF}the week.
Only Thursday and Friday left, {LF}then it's the weekend!
Your dad built this school, didn't he, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
He's so cool!
Fridays always make me {LF}sleepy in the spring.
You're that way all the time!
I like Mana's classes since {LF}they're easy to understand.
I like Barrett's better.
It's hot. These are the days {LF}you should go outside {LF}and move about.
No way! These days are best {LF}for staying in with a book.
The ocean is the best place in {LF}summer. I just want to read a book {LF}by the shore.
I like the ocean part, but reading? {LF}What's with that?
What do you like to do in your free {LF}time, Sera?
Reading, of course! What about you, {LF}Serena?
I like to play tag.
You like anything that gets {LF}you moving.
Tomorrow's our day off! {LF}We can play all day.
If you don't exercise you won't {LF}grow up to be big and strong.
Especially in your case.
I'll let you take care of that {LF}for both of us!
Autumn's when my appetite kicks {LF}into high gear.
I knew you'd say that, Serena.
Autumn's a great season for exercise!
I just like to read books by {LF}the window in the autumn.
I like school. But I hate studying. {LF}I love just playing with friends in {LF}my free time.
I like just reading as many {LF}books as I can.
Do you like reading, ＠アルス＠＠?
You like waving your sword {LF}around in the forest more than {LF}books, don't you?
I can't believe it's already Friday. {LF}This week just flew by.
We're free tomorrow!
It's gotten really cold lately. All the {LF}more reason to get some exercise. {LF}Let's play tag!
Reading is  the best thing to {LF}do when it's cold out.
I like looking at the snow outside{LF}from the window. Makes me {LF}want to have a snowball fight.
It's so pretty!
I bet the teachers would get {LF}mad if we played with a ball {LF}inside the classroom.
No matter how cold it is outside, {LF}it's always warm inside the school.
Barrett's lessons are a little {LF}hard to follow, but I still like them.
Mana's lessons are  {LF}only about cooking.
I start to feel a little lonely {LF}on Fridays. After all, there's {LF}no school the next day.
I thought everyone looked {LF}forward to Fridays.
I hate the way the clinic smells.
I love the way it smells.
They say you gotta be foolish{LF}to catch a cold in summer.
Great! I have nothing to worry about!
What's that supposed to mean?
You need to watch you don't eat {LF}too much in autumn.
But potatoes are sooo delish!
It's so cold now!
But it's warm inside the house!
Father Gordon would get mad if we {LF}played inside the church.
Play? I came to pray!
Every day's so hot. I feel like I'm {LF}gonna faint.
If you're gonna faint, then the clinic {LF}is the best place to be!
They say Father Gordon fought the {LF}dragons a long time ago. I wonder if {LF}he won?
He's so incredible!
The church is really beautiful.
I  love the stained glass {LF}windows!
Let's play again today!
Play!
Nice to meet you. I'm Serena.
I'm Sera.
I'm ＠アルス＠＠.
I'm ＠アルス＠＠.
We're twins.
Twins!
Our dad's Ray. He's a doctor.
Our mom's Yue!
Our mom's Rosalind!
I love to exercise.
I love to read!
You should see all the {LF}complicated books she gets into.
One time she read all the magic {LF}books on Dad's bookshelves.
Books about magic are so fun!
Wow, you understand them?
Wow, you understand them?
I  don't, but they're still fun.
If you're interested in that sorta {LF}thing, ＠アルス＠＠, you should {LF}read them too.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Well, see ya 'round, ＠アルス＠＠!
Bye, ＠アルス＠＠!
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠!
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hiya, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hiya, ＠アルス＠＠.
Evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠. Here's {LF}to a whole new year of opportunity!
To a new year!
Today's the Flower Festival, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. The cherry blossoms {LF}are beautiful, aren't they?
So beautiful! Let's to look at them {LF}together, ＠アルス＠＠.
Sure, let's go.
Sorry, but I'm kinda busy.
Yeah, let's go. {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}would be a good place.
Sounds good.
Yay!
Go on ahead to {LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}We'll catch up with you.
Sorry, but I can't go with you.
Sorry, but I can't go with you.
Oh, okay... 
Aw boo.
Today's the Flower Festival.
I love the cherry blossoms. {LF}They're so pretty.
You go on ahead to {LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}We'll be there in a jiff.
Make sure you come, {LF}＠アルス＠＠!
That was fun, huh, ＠アルス＠＠?
Really fun!
Today's the Flower Festival.
Flowers!
Yeah.
The cherry blossoms are pretty,{LF}aren't they?
Sure are.
So pretty!
We're going to enter the contest {LF}too. What about you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}I won't be holding back.
You were great, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Sorry you lost.
That was amazing, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Too bad you didn't win.
Ray was better than I thought he'd be.
Amazing!
You did it! You won!
You came in first! That's awesome!
Summer is finally here! I love to {LF}swim in summer!
I'm not so good at swimming.
Are you going to enter {LF}the contest, ＠アルス＠＠?
I hope you win, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You did it!
That was  awesome, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. You were great.
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠. You {LF}did it!
That was so awesome,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. You were great.
Today's the Dance Festival! {LF}Are you going to dance, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I want to dance!
Dance with me.
Maybe later.
You wanna dance with me? {LF}Awesome! Let's boogie!
I wanna dance too!
Sorry, ＠アルス＠＠. I've got something {LF}else I need to do right now.
Me too... 
Oh, okay.
Okay.
That was fun, ＠アルス＠＠. We should {LF}dance together again!
I wanna dance!
Thanks for asking me, {LF}＠アルス＠＠, but I can't.
Sorry!
Have you already danced, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I haven't yet!
Today's the Dance Festival! Are you {LF}good at dancing, ＠アルス＠＠?
Girls want to be asked {LF}to dance!
We'll be in it. Are you going,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}I'm not holding back.
You're pretty good, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Sorry you lost, though.
You're good, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Too bad you didn't win.
Leann looks like a good chef.
A really good chef!
We did it! We won!
We're first! Yay! You should {LF}try our food too, ＠アルス＠＠.
Are you going to compete too, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I hope you win, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You did it!
You were great, ＠アルス＠＠.
Sorry you didn't win, ＠アルス＠＠.
You'll do it next year, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
It's time to give thanks to Mother {LF}Earth. That's what the grown-ups {LF}are saying, anyway.
Give thanks!
Are you going to compete, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I hope you win, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You did it!
You were great, ＠アルス＠＠.
Did you lose, ＠アルス＠＠?
I'll make you feel better, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}I can't wait for tonight.
Today's the one time we can {LF}stay up late without our parents {LF}getting angry.
Let's look at the stars together
I dunno if I can stay up that late
You wanna go with me?
What about me? {LF}You don't wanna go with me?
Let's go look at them together.
Let's go look at them together.
Okay, ＠アルス＠＠, see you at 9 {LF}o'clock tonight at {LF}＠マップ９＠!
You better be there!
Sorry, we can't really go together.
Yeah, we're not that good friends yet.
I feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
I'm tired!
Be at ＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9 o'clock, ＠アルス＠＠!
I'm looking forward to seeing {LF}some shooting stars.
Sorry, maybe next year!
Sorry!
How pretty were those shooting stars! {LF}I'm glad we were able to go together, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Don't forget I was there too.{LF}It was fun watching them with {LF}you guys.
I bet you've invited somebody else, {LF}haven't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Yeah, I bet!
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}I can move faster than any star {LF}you'll see up there!
I like reading books under the {LF}starlight. A little hard to see, though.
Are you going to enter the contest {LF}too, ＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck out there, ＠アルス＠＠!
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You did it!
You were great, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was too bad, ＠アルス＠＠.
I know you'll do it next time, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Looks like it's the end of the year, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm looking forward to hanging {LF}out again next year.
Let's play hide-and-seek, ＠アルス＠＠!
Yeah, let's play!
Sure!
Sure!
We'll go hide once you're out of sight!
I bet you'll never find us!
Ready... Set... 
Go!
We'll hide once we know you can't {LF}see us!
You'll be left scratching your head!
Shoot, you found us!
Aw, boo!
You could have hidden in{LF}different spots. I mean, there{LF}ARE two of you...
You could have hidden in{LF}different spots. I mean, there{LF}ARE two of you...
Impossible!
We're inseparable!
I see...
I see...
That was fun! Let's play again{LF}sometime!
Oh, that's right! We want you {LF}to have this!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
I love ＠アイテム９＠!
I love it, too!{LF}Try it, ＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, your backpack is full!{LF}I can't give it to you now!
Let's play again.
I wanna play again.
Bad news!
What's up?
What's up?
I was playing hide and seek with {LF}Sera, and I can't find her!
We always hide together when we're {LF}playing with someone else, but today {LF}we were playing by ourselves.
That is bad news. We better find her.
That is bad news. We better find her.
Please help!
Maybe she'll come home when it {LF}gets dark...I'm so worried about her. {LF}Please find her!
Thanks so much for finding Sera!
I was so happy to see you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
You're the best!
Here, I want you to have this! I made {LF}it myself!
I want some too!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks again. Really.
Thank you!
Wait, your backpack's full!{LF}Make some space!
Thanks again. Really. {LF}I hope you like the cookie.
Thank you! I want a cookie too.
Let's play a game, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}What should we play?
Let's play "Who's Who?"!
What's that?
What's that?
You'll see!
Yeah! You'll see!
Okay, let's play!
Okay, let's play!
Here we go!
Watch closely!
Which of us is Sera?
Yeah, which one?
Sera's on the right!
Sera's on the left!
I don't have any idea!
Bingo!
That was amazing, ＠アルス＠＠! {LF}Sometimes even our mom and dad {LF}can't tell.
Take this for being right on {LF}that one!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
That was fun. Let's play again.
Again!
Boo! Hiss! Wrong answer!
Wanna try again?
Sure!
No.
Really? Okay! We can play again{LF}later!
Later!
Sorry. We weren't trying to make you {LF}mad, ＠アルス＠＠.
You don't like this game, do you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Here, maybe this'll make up for it!{LF}Sorry! 
Sorry!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
If you change your mind, let us know, {LF}and we'll play again!
Play!
Whoops! Your backpack's full!
Make some space!
It's fun playing with you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Really fun!
Say, do you like me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
What?! Um, well... 
What?! Um, well... 
Yeah!
Not really...
I see... 
... 
Okay, forget what we put on the{LF}bulletin board, okay?
Yay!
What about me?{LF}Do you like me, too?
I like you, too.
No, not really...
Hooray!
Okay then, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}We want you to bring us the{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
Find it for us!
What's that?
What's that?
Just go find it and we'll tell you!
Find it!
All right, but where is it, exactly?
All right, but where is it, exactly?
Leann's seen it before!{LF}Try asking her!
Ask her!
All right!
All right!
Go find the ＠アイテム９＠ for us!
Leann knows about it!
You found the ＠アイテム９＠? {LF}Yay!
Gimme!
Spring's the season for{LF}outdoor activity.
Spring's the season for reading.
Every day's a scorcher, isn't it?
That's why it's perfect for {LF}reading.
Autumn's great for getting out.
Autumn's great for staying in {LF}with a book.
Reading in front of the fire is what {LF}winter's for.
Winter's the only time you can play in {LF}the snow!
I hope we can become closer friends, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Yeah!
You like to exercise, ＠アルス＠＠?
I bet you prefer reading, don't {LF}you, ＠アルス＠＠?
It's fun talking to you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Do you like me, ＠アルス＠＠?
We should play more often,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Play!
I'm glad we became friends, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Me too!
We heard you defeated a big monster {LF}in Trieste Forest, ＠アルス＠＠.
You're incredible, ＠アルス＠＠.
I don't think any of the grown-ups {LF}realize it. But the kids...{LF}we all know it.
The kids are in the know, but the {LF}adults are clueless.
We heard you defeated a big monster {LF}on Blessia Island, ＠アルス＠＠.
You're awesome!
You keep taking out those monsters, {LF}don't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You're so strong, ＠アルス＠＠.
You're so strong, it's not a {LF}surprise anymore when you beat{LF}big monsters now, ＠アルス＠＠.
I'm surprised! But I'm more surprised{LF}how none of the grown-ups realize it!
Where would Barrett have {LF}hidden the book?
Well, you know what they  {LF}say. "Best place to hide a tree {LF}is in a forest." It'll be in a library {LF}or somewhere like that.
If you're looking for Barrett's {LF}magic book, I think you should {LF}check out the library.
It'll be tucked away in a corner {LF}somewhere.
You finally did it, ＠アルス＠＠.
Amazing!
We heard your daddy came back! That's{LF}great, huh, ＠アルス＠＠?
Yay! It makes me happy, too!
Every day's such a blast.
So fun!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠! I'm so glad you {LF}found me!
We were playing hide-and-seek, and{LF}I got lost!
I'm glad I found you, too! Serena's {LF}worried about you! You're not injured, {LF}are you?
I'm glad I found you, too! Serena's {LF}worried about you! You're not injured, {LF}are you?
I'm fine! In fact, seeing you{LF}cheered me up!
I'm okay now! Thank you!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠. Well this is a surprise.
Hey!
So you came, ＠アルス＠＠.
When are the stars going to  {LF}start falling?
I hope we get to see them.
I wanna see!
Yeah, I'm dying to see them.
Come on, come on... 
Hurry... 
I saw one! They're so pretty.
Beautiful!
They're really something.
I wanna see more!
More more!
There goes another! All right!
Yay!
Wow. It's amazing.
I'd love to race one of those.
I bet you'd win.
Ha ha ha.
Dang, I forgot we were racing.
That's too bad.
It's gotten cold all of a sudden, huh?
Chilly!
Yeah, a little bit. Should we head {LF}back home?
I wanna see some more. I can put up {LF}with it.
Oh, well come closer to me. I'll keep {LF}you warm.
Okey-doke.
Okay!
Mmm, much warmer, ＠アルス＠＠.
So warm.
Being between you guys is keeping {LF}me warm too.
Great!
Yay!
I'm glad we got to see the stars together.
I'm so happy!
I'm glad I got to see them with {LF}both of you, too.
That was nice.
It was!
Okay, we should go home now.
Yeah.
We should do this again!
I hope today will be another fun day.
I hope so too!
This is it!
It's it!
So, uh, what am I supposed to{LF}do with this?
So, uh, what am I supposed to{LF}do with this?
Propose to us!
Yeah, propose to us, ＠アルス＠＠!
What?! P-Propose? You mean like,{LF}getting married?
What?! P-Propose? You mean like,{LF}getting married?
Yeah! Grownups propose toast with{LF}fancy glasses! Then they get married{LF}and have, uh, toast, I think!
Yay! I want to get married and{LF}have some toast!
B-But we're still just kids!
Toast? Uh, I don't know if{LF}that's quite right...
Don't you like Sera?
Don't you like Serena?
No, I do, but... 
No, I do, but... 
Okay then!
No problem!
But... 
But... 
To the church!
Yes! You need to propose toast to{LF}us!{LF}
Do you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}take Sera and Serena to be your wives,{LF}to have and to hold{LF}from this day forward,
for better, for worse, for richer,{LF}for poorer, in sickness and in health,{LF}to love and to cherish, {LF}till death us do part?
Um... 
Um... 
Ha ha ha!{LF}I guess you're too young to{LF}promise that.
Come on ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}we're trying to play wedding here!{LF}
Come on, play along!
You're just playing?
You're just playing?
Of course!
Of course!
You had me worried!{LF}Ha ha ha.
You had me worried!{LF}Ha ha ha.
We've been trying all{LF}kinds of different games lately.{LF}Ha ha ha!
But when we're older,{LF}I don't think I'd mind {LF}being your wife for real,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Me neither!
Sera, you can't marry ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}because I'm going to!
Nuh-uh!{LF}I am, so you'd better give up!
No way!
It's not gonna happen!
Come on, both of you... 
Come on, both of you... 
Ha ha ha!{LF}You're popular, ＠アルス＠＠!
I can't marry two people.{LF}There's no way.
I can't marry two people.{LF}There's no way.{LF}
Really?
I didn't know that.
But I had fun, anyway.
I hope I can get married{LF}for real someday.
That was fun,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Let's play again soon, okay?
Let's play again!
You're giving this to me?{LF}I'll try it out.
I want half!
Delicious!{LF}Thanks!
I want more!
You're giving this to me?{LF}I'll try it out.
I want half!
Delicious!{LF}Thanks!{LF}I'm starting to like you a little,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I like you too!
Thanks!{LF}I love this!
Thanks!{LF}I love it!
Sorry,{LF}I don't like this very much.
I hate it, actually.
I love this, but... {LF}I'd rather get it on my birthday.
Our birthday's important!
Thanks!{LF}It's my birthday today.{LF}I'm happy to get a nice{LF}＠アイテム９＠ on my birthday!
I'm happy too!
Thanks, but we only need one{LF}present for my birthday.
It's not as special if we{LF}get too many.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
You're giving us this?
You are?
I love holidays!
I want to relax and read a book!
Mondays get me all melon collie.
Melon collie? What's that mean?
I don't know, but I've heard{LF}grown-ups say it before.
Oh.
I want to go outside!{LF}I wish this school{LF}had a playground.
I just want to read a book.
It's the middle of the week!
Only two days left {LF}until the weekend!
Didn't your father {LF}make this school,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
That's incredible!
I get so sleepy on {LF}Fridays in the spring.
Aren't you always {LF}that way, Serena?
I like Mana's classes.{LF}They're easy to understand.
I like Barrett's better!
It's hot out today.{LF}It's perfect for playing outside!
Are you serious? No way!{LF}It's perfect for staying{LF}inside and reading a book!
Summers are great for{LF}going to the beach and{LF}reading a book.
You're right about{LF}going to the beach,{LF}but isn't it strange{LF}to read a book there?
What do you do when there's{LF}no school, Sera?
I read, of course.{LF}Serena?
Tag, maybe.
Serena, you're always running around.
No school tomorrow!{LF}We should play all day!
You've gotta get some exercise{LF}if you wanna grow up strong!
Look who's talking!
Between the two of us,{LF}we're good at anything!
There's so much good food{LF}to eat in the fall.
I thought you'd say that, Serena.
Fall is a great time to exercise!
It's an even better time{LF}to curl up in front of{LF}the window with a good book!
School's fun,{LF}except for the studying.{LF}It's better to get to play{LF}with my friends on the weekend!
And there's plenty of time to read!
Do you like to read,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I bet ＠アルス＠＠ would rather{LF}fight monsters in the forest!
It's Friday already!
No school tomorrow!
It's cold out today,{LF}but it's not so bad if {LF}we're running around!{LF}We should play some tag!
We should stay inside and read!
The snow is so pretty outside.{LF}We should have a snowball fight!
It's so pretty!
I wonder if we'd get yelled at{LF}if we played catch inside?
It's too cold outside,{LF}but it's nice and warm in here.
Barrett's classes are hard,{LF}but I like them anyway.
Mana's classes are{LF}nothing but cooking.
Fridays are kind of lonely,{LF}'cause there's no school tomorrow.
You're weird.{LF}Normal kids look {LF}forward to no school!
I don't like the smell of clinics.
I like it.
You'd have to be pretty{LF}dumb to catch a cold in{LF}the summer!
Well, I guess I don't need to {LF}worry about it then!
Are you saying that I do?
You've gotta be careful not to{LF}eat too much in the fall.
But there's so much good food!
It's cold out today.
But it's nice and warm inside!
If we play inside the church{LF}Father Gordon will get mad at us.
I didn't come here to play,{LF}I came here to pray!
Why does it always have to be so hot?{LF}I'm feel like I'm gonna faint.
If you're going to faint,{LF}you'd better do it in the clinic!
Father Gordon once fought a dragon!{LF}I wonder if he won?
He's like a real life hero!
This church is pretty.
The stained glass windows{LF}are beautiful!
Let's play all day long!
Let's play!
Hi!{LF}I'm Serena.
I'm Sera!
I'm ＠アルス＠＠.
I'm ＠アルス＠＠.
We're twins!
Both of us!
Ray's our father.{LF}He's a doctor.
Yue's our mother.
Rosalind's our mother.
I like to play outside!
I like to read!
Sera reads really difficult books.
She's even started to read{LF}some of father's magic books!
Magic books are fun!
Wow, really? Do you understand them?
Wow, really? Do you understand them?
Not really... {LF}But they're fun!
I bet you'd like them too, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You should try reading them!
Okay.
Okay.
Talk to you later,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Bye, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.

I'm sorry,{LF}I can't go with you.
I'm sorry,{LF}I can't go with you.
Oh... 
That's too bad!
Today's the Flower Festival.
The cherry blossoms are so pretty.
Go on ahead to{LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}We'll be right there.
So hurry up, okay,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
That was fun,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
I had fun too!
Today's the Flower Festival.
It's the Flower Festival!
Yeah.
They're pretty!{LF}The cherry blossoms.
Yeah.
They're beautiful!
We're gonna be in the competition.{LF}How about you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You too, Sera!
＠アルス＠＠, you were great!{LF}It's too bad I lost, though.
You're incredible, {LF}＠アルス＠＠! Amazing!{LF}I just wish I didn't lose... 
Ray's a lot better than he looks.
He is, really!
I won!
I won!{LF}Yay!
It's the first day of summer.{LF}I love to swim in summer.
I'm not very good at it... 
Are you going to be {LF}in the competition,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
Nice, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You're amazing!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
Nice, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You're amazing!
Today is the Dance Festival!{LF}Are you going to dance,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I want to dance!
Dance with me.
I might.
You want to dance with me?{LF}Yay!{LF}Let's dance!
I wanna dance too!
Sorry, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I've got other plans.
Me too.
Oh... 
Oh... 
That was fun,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I want to dance with you again!
I want to dance too!
I'm really sorry I couldn't{LF}dance with you.
We had another obligation!
Did you already have a dance, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I haven't!
Today is the Dance Festival!{LF}Are you a good dancer,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Girls would rather be asked out{LF}than have to ask someone out.
We're gonna be in the competition.{LF}How about you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You too, Sera!
＠アルス＠＠, you were great!{LF}It's too bad I lost, though.
You're incredible, {LF}＠アルス＠＠! Amazing!{LF}I just wish I didn't lose...
Leann looks like she'd be {LF}good at cooking.
I bet she's really good at it.
I did it, I won!
I won!{LF}＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you should try some of my food!
Are you going to be {LF}in the competition,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
Nice, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You're amazing!
That's too bad, ＠アルス＠＠.
You'll get it next year, ＠アルス＠＠!
It's time to give thanks for{LF}the blessings of the land.{LF}That's what the grown-ups all say.
Are you going to be {LF}in the competition,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
Nice, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You're amazing!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
You lost, ＠アルス＠＠?
I'll cheer you up,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I can't wait until tonight!
This is the only day of{LF}the year we get to stay up{LF}late without getting yelled at!
Let's watch the stars together.
I wonder if I can stay up that late...
Do you want to watch {LF}the stars with me?
What about me?{LF}Don't you want to {LF}watch them with me, too?
Let's all go together.
Let's all go together.
Okay, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}meet us at{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9:00!
See you there!
I'm sorry,{LF}I can't go with you.
I don't know you well{LF}enough yet.
I'm getting tired.
Me too.
Meet us at{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9:00!
I'm glad I got to see {LF}the shooting stars!
I'm sorry.{LF}Ask me again next year, okay?
Okay?
That was pretty, wasn't it?{LF}I had fun watching the shooting{LF}stars with you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, don't forget me!{LF}It was fun because the three of{LF}us all watched them together.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}haven't you already invited{LF}someone else?
You did, didn't you?
Today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Big deal! I can run faster {LF}than a shooting star, anyway.
I like to read by starlight.{LF}Dad says it'll hurt my eyes,{LF}but I can't help it.
Are you going to be {LF}in the competition,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Good luck,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Great job, ＠アルス＠＠.
Nice, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You're amazing!
Too bad, ＠アルス＠＠.
I'm sure you'll win next time!
It's the end of the year.
Happy New Year,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Let's play hide-and-seek,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Yeah, let's play!
Sure!
Sure!
We'll go hide as soon as you{LF}can't see us!
Good luck finding us!
Ready...?
Go!
We'll go hide as soon as you{LF}can't see us!
We'll vanish into thin air!
Ah! We've been found!
You found us!
You could have hidden in{LF}different spots. I mean, there{LF}ARE two of you...
You could have hidden in{LF}different spots. I mean, there{LF}ARE two of you...
No way!
We're inseparable!
I see...
I see...
That was fun! We should play again{LF}sometime!
Yeah, let's play again sometime!{LF}Oh, here, why don't you take this?
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
I love ＠アイテム９＠!
I love it, too!{LF}Try it, ＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, your backpack is full!{LF}I can't give it to you now!
Let's play again!
Yeah, let's play again sometime!
Oh no!
What happened?
What happened?
I was playing hide-and-seek{LF}with Sera, but I can't find her!
We usually just hide together,{LF}but this time we were only{LF}playing with the two of us!
That's not good! You'd better{LF}find her soon!
That's not good! You'd better{LF}find her soon!
Please, help me!
I'm sure she'll come home{LF}when it gets dark, but I'm{LF}worried...Please, help{LF}me find her!
Thanks for finding Sera!
I was so happy when you{LF}came to find me!
You're always so helpful,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
You are!
Here, take this!{LF}I made it myself!
Hey, give me one, too!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks again!
Thank you!
Oh, your backpack is full!{LF}Make some space!
Thanks again.{LF}I hope you like my cookie!
Thank you!{LF}I want a cookie too!
＠アルス＠＠! Let's play!{LF}Let's play! Um... What{LF}should we play?
Let's play "Who's Who?"!
What kind of game is that?
What kind of game is that?
You'll find out!
Yeah! You'll find out!
Okay, let's play it!
Okay, let's play it!
Here we go!
Who's who?
Which one is Sera?
Which one?
Sera's on the right!
Sera's on the left!
I don't have any idea!
Correct!
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Even our own mom and dad{LF}get us mixed up sometimes!
Here's your prize!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
That was fun! We should play{LF}again sometime.
Let's play again!
Wrong! Too bad!
Do you want to try again?
Sure.
No, that's enough.
Okay! Let's play again{LF}sometime!
Again!
Sorry. We weren't trying to make you {LF}mad, ＠アルス＠＠.
You don't like this game, do you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Here, maybe this'll make up for it!{LF}Sorry! 
Sorry!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
If you change your mind, let us know, {LF}and we'll play again!
Play!
Whoops! Your backpack's full!
Make some space!
It's fun playing with you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I like it too!
Umm... ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}do you like me?
What?! Um... 
What?! Um... 
I like you.
No, not really...
I see... 
... 
Okay, forget what we put on the{LF}bulletin board, okay?
Yay!
What about me?{LF}Do you like me, too?
I like you, too.
No, not really...
Hooray!
Okay then, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}We want you to bring us the{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
Find it for us!
What is that?
What is that?
Don't worry about it!{LF}Just find it for us,{LF}okay?
Find it!
Okay... But where can I find it?
Okay... But where can I find it?
Ask Leann! I've heard that she's{LF}seen it!
Go ask Leann!
Okay.
Okay.
Find us the{LF}＠アイテム９＠!
Leann knows about it!
You found the ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}Great!
Let me see it!
Spring is a good time to exercise.
No, it's a good time to read!
It's so hot outside.
It's perfect for reading!
Fall is a good time to exercise.
No, it's a good time to read!
Winter's great because{LF}I get to curl up by the{LF}fireplace with a good book.
No, it's great because{LF}we get to play in the snow!
I want us to be good friends, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Me too!
Do you like playing outside,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Nuh-uh, I bet ＠アルス＠＠{LF}would rather read instead.
You're fun to talk to,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Do you like Sera,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I wish we could play all of the{LF}time, ＠アルス＠＠!
Me too!
I'm glad we got to be friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm glad too!
I heard that you fought{LF}a huge monster in Trieste Forest!{LF}
You're amazing,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
The grown-ups don't know{LF}anything about it, but all the{LF}kids have been talking about it.
We're keeping it a {LF}secret from the adults, {LF}but we all know!
I heard that one time you fought{LF}a huge monster in Blessia Island.
I knew you could do it!
Did you beat another monster,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
You're so strong!
You've gotten so strong,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, that{LF}everyone's kinda used to you{LF}beating monsters now.
I'm amazed that you got so tough!{LF}But I'm more amazed that the adults{LF}still don't have a clue!
Are you looking for the{LF}book that Barrett hid?
Have you ever heard the saying,{LF}"If you need to hide a tree,{LF}hide it in a forest?"{LF}I bet he's hiding it in a library!
If Barrett is hiding a book,{LF}I'm sure that he'd hide it somewhere{LF}in the library.
He probably hid it in some corner.
You did it, ＠アルス＠＠!
I can't believe it!
Your daddy came back!{LF}That's great, ＠アルス＠＠!
Yay! I'm glad he's back!
I'm having so much fun.
I'm having fun too!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You came!
We were playing hide-and-seek,{LF}and I got lost,{LF}and I couldn't make it back home,{LF}and I was so scared!
Everything's okay now, Sera.{LF}But we should get you back.{LF}Serena's been so worried.{LF}Are you hurt?
Everything's okay now, Sera.{LF}But we should get you back.{LF}Serena's been so worried.{LF}Are you hurt?
I'm fine!{LF}I feel better now that you're here,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
I think I can make it back now.{LF}Thank you!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}how unusual!
How unusual!
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you made it.
Are there going to be {LF}any shooting stars tonight?
I wonder if we'll be able to see any.
I hope so!
Yeah, I want to see them!
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry up!
I just saw one!{LF}It's pretty!
Beautiful!
It's pretty, isn't it.
More! More!
More!
There's another one!{LF}
There was!
Yeah,{LF}it's really something.
I'd love to race against the stars.
You'd definitely win, Serena!
Ha ha ha!
Ah, but I missed the start.
That's too bad!
It's starting to get cold.
Brrr!
Yeah, it's a little cold, isn't it?{LF}We should go home.
I'd like to watch a little longer.{LF}I can take it.
Okay.{LF}Here, come closer to me.{LF}I'll keep you warm.
Okay.
Sure!
＠アルス＠＠, you're so warm!
You're warm!
Both of you are warming me up too!
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
I'm glad we got to watch {LF}the stars together,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Me too!
I'm glad I got to see them {LF}with both of you, too.
That was nice.
It was!
Okay, let's go home now.
Yeah.
We should do this again!
I hope today will be another fun day.
I hope so too!
I'm here to deliver this.{LF}Julia found it at her bathhouse.
Hey, that's my book of scriptures!{LF}I didn't even notice I'd lost it!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You didn't notice?{LF}I thought that would be {LF}important to you.
Of course it's important to me. But the {LF}book itself isn't what is important. {LF}Just knowing the scriptures {LF}isn't everything. 
What's matters is to believe in them {LF}and to truly live by them.{LF}You'd do well to learn that,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'll try to remember that.
Does it sound like I'm just making{LF}up an excuse for misplacing the book?{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Thank you for bringing it back to me.{LF}Be sure give Julia my thanks!
I will.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Gordon, I've brought your{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
It looks like it's all in one piece.{LF}Good work, ＠カイル＠＠.
Here, take this.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You've been a real help.{LF}I'll let you know if{LF}I need anything else.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Gordon, here's your{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
＠カイル＠＠, you made it back!{LF}I knew I could count on you.
Well, you held up {LF}your end of the deal. {LF}Here's your payment.{LF}Go ahead, take it.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I've got something else for you, too.
You got 100 wood!
Thank you very much.
We've got to look out for one{LF}another in this world.{LF}It's the golden rule, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You've really helped me this time.{LF}It's hard keeping up with my daughters!{LF}Thanks.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Gordon, I've brought your{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Oh, thank you.
This is exactly what I was looking for.{LF}Good job, ＠カイル＠＠.
Well, you held up {LF}your end of the deal. {LF}Here's your payment.{LF}Go ahead, take it.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You've really become{LF}someone I can count on.{LF}If I need any more help,{LF}I'll be sure to let you know.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I knew I could rely on you.
Here, your reward.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Sorry to bother you again!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
What's wrong, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I gave this to you in the first place.
You're holding it.
Got the {LF}＠アイテム９＠ back.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
Oh, did you get it back from Cammy?{LF}I knew she'd listen to another child!
You've been a big help!{LF}Here, take this as my thanks!
You got: ＠数字９＠G!
I've got something else for you, too!{LF}It should help you with your studies!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
It looks like you're carrying too much.{LF}Could you free up some space in {LF}your backpack?
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
＠アイテム９＠? Whatcha giving me{LF}that for?
It's from Egan.
It's from Egan.
Oh, I see! You delivered it here{LF}for him! Thanks!
Wow, this looks delicious!{LF}That Egan sure is a good{LF}cook!
Here, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Have a bite!
*munch* *munch*{LF}It's yummy!
*munch* *munch*{LF}Wow, it's yummy!
Egan's food is really delicious!
Egan's food is really delicious!
Ga ha ha ha! I knew you'd{LF}like it!
Anyway, be sure to tell Egan{LF}thanks for me!
I will!
I will!
You've brought me something good!{LF}I just can't resist these.{LF}Thanks!
You're giving me a{LF}＠アイテム８＠?{LF}I can feel the excitement rushing{LF}in my blood just by looking at it.
I don't really need this... 
Hey, you!{LF}Don't ever bring me one of these again!
I'm allergic to Woolies!
You've brought me something good!{LF}I just can't resist these.{LF}Thanks!
You're giving me a{LF}＠アイテム８＠?{LF}I can feel the excitement rushing{LF}in my blood just by looking at it.
I don't really need this... 
Hey, you!{LF}Are you trying to play a joke on me?
I'm allergic to Woolies!
Gordon, please drink this.
You have something for me?{LF}Which is it?
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}You're a big help, as always,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Here, this is for you.
Here, this is for you.
You have something for me?{LF}Which is it?
Ba ha ha ha! Thanks for being{LF}such good friends with Cammy.
You're giving this to me even{LF}though it's not my birthday?{LF}I'd enjoy it more then.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You're giving this to me even{LF}though it's not my birthday?{LF}I'd enjoy it more then.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You're giving this to me even{LF}though it's not my birthday?{LF}I'd enjoy it more then.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You remembered my birthday!{LF}Thanks!
I've already gotten{LF}a present from you today.{LF}Thanks, but one is enough for me.{LF}Waste not, want not.
I've already gotten{LF}a present from you today.{LF}Thanks, but one is enough for me.{LF}Waste not, want not.
I can't give this.

Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thanks, I'll take it.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Oh, you're giving this to me?{LF}Thanks, I'll take it.
Do you go to the clinic when{LF}something is wrong with you?{LF}I only go there when I want a drink!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Do you go to the clinic when{LF}something is wrong with you?{LF}I only go there when I want a drink!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!

Are you going to buy something?
Are you going to buy something?
Are you going to buy something?
Are you going to buy something?
Flowers are blooming everywhere.{LF}It makes me want a drink.
Summer has been hot since the{LF}beginning of time.{LF}So you'd better get used to it!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
The western part of the town{LF}has a nice, laid back atmosphere.
There's snow as far as the eye can see.{LF}Be careful not to catch a cold!
People are always passing through here.{LF}It's a good place to be if{LF}you want to hear the latest gossip.
Even though it's hot outside,{LF}don't shut yourself indoors all day. {LF}You'll get weak.
There's always someone around here.{LF}I think that's why a lot of people{LF}come by this place when they get bored.
This town looks serene{LF}all covered in snow.
You come here too?{LF}The baths are nice and huge,{LF}don't you think!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
There's nothing like a {LF}really hot bath in the summer.{LF}Nothing beats the feeling{LF}when you step out of the bath!{LF}
Ba ha ha ha!
Cammy loves the huge baths here,{LF}but she just starts splashing{LF}and swimming around in them!{LF}I can't get her to behave.
It's hard work, raising daughters!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
It feels great to{LF}just dive right into the bath.{LF}You should try it,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Oh, did you come to hear{LF}one of my sermons?{LF}Have a seat, and listen well... 
In the beginning, there was... 
So-Sorry! I have to get going{LF}now! We'll have to save it{LF}for next time!
Oh, did you come to hear{LF}one of my sermons?{LF}Have a seat, and listen well...
In this world... 
Sorry, I have to get going now.{LF}We'll have to save it for next time.

In this world... 
Sorry, I have to get going now.{LF}We'll have to save it for next time.
Are you looking for some advice?{LF}If you're having trouble, {LF}I'd be glad to listen,{LF}no matter what it is.
No, not really.{LF}Maybe another time.
Oh, that's...boring.{LF}You don't have a whole lot going on,{LF}do you?
Well, if anything happens,{LF}you can always come talk to me.
Thanks. I'll be sure to.
You came all the way into my church.{LF}Is there something you need to ask me?
No, I just wandered in, really... 
Oh, I see.
It's not good to keep{LF}all your troubles to yourself.
If you ever need anything{LF}you can always come talk to me.
Thanks. I'll be sure to.
Thanks for coming.{LF}It's nice to have a visitor.
If you stick around,{LF}I'll let you join in my prayer{LF}of thanksgiving.
Oh, that's nice of you,{LF}but I really need to get going...
That's too bad.
I guess it's just good enough{LF}that you came to church!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Thanks for coming.{LF}It's nice to have a visitor.
Now then!{LF}Let's fill our hearts with prayer!
Ah, oh... really?
What, don't you feel very thankful?
It sounds like you need to hear{LF}more of my sermons!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
My name is Gordon.{LF}I got this scar over my right eye{LF}fighting a dragon in my youth.
R-Really?{LF}Are you a warrior?
A warrior?{LF}Look at how I'm dressed.{LF}I'm obviously a priest!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
"Thou shalt not kill."{LF}I'm strictly a pacifist now!
I...I see... So, what happened{LF}to the dragon?
Well! I gave him a swift low kick,{LF}and followed it up with a one-two{LF}combination! Left to the solar plexus!{LF}Right uppercut!
I sent him all the way back to {LF}the Forest of Beginnings!
(H-He doesn't sound like{LF}a pacifist at all!)
By the way, I don't think I've{LF}seen you around here before... {LF}Did you just move here?
Yes. My name's ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm borrowing the farmland{LF}just outside of town.
Ah! You mean Douglas' place?
You know Douglas?
Course I do! For as long as I{LF}can remember, we've been rivals!{LF}Everyone in town is always trying to{LF}guess which one of us is stronger!
Truth be told, though, he'd only last{LF}about three seconds against me if{LF}I really tried!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Y-You don't say...
That's right! Anyway, remember{LF}to come to church on holidays,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
I'll warn you now, if you fall{LF}asleep during one of my sermons, {LF}I'll send you to Heaven early!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Y-Yes, sir!
Good morning.
Hello.
Good evening.
Oh, good morning.
Oh, hello.
Oh, good evening.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.

Happy New Year,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!

Today is the Eating Contest.{LF}I'm planning on entering it myself.
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}I can't believe it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Whoever said that you can't judge{LF}a book by its cover was right!
That's too bad.{LF}You should try again next year.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}God blessed me with strength this year!
There's a festival today, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Go out and have fun!
You did it.{LF}I didn't think you had it in you.
That's too bad.{LF}You should try again next year.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}God blessed me with strength this year!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠. It's the start{LF}of swimming season. There's nothing{LF}like a good swim to cool off on a{LF}hot summer day.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Swimming season starts today. {LF}The sea is perfect for such {LF}darned hot days like today.
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}The trick with monsters{LF}is that you can't just use raw strength{LF}to force them to your will.
You wouldn't want to send them{LF}running all the way to the {LF}Forest of Beginnings would you?
You need heart to capture monsters.{LF}It's important not to forget that.
You understand, right?{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Congratulations, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}It looks like you took{LF}my advice to heart!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You can't just use your physical{LF}strength to force monsters to obey you.{LF}You'll understand one day,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Today's the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. It's dangerous for{LF}children to handle monsters.{LF}You're better off just watching.
Congratulations, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You did it!{LF}You really surprised me.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
You can't just use your physical{LF}strength to force monsters to obey you.{LF}You'll understand one day,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}When I was younger, I used go around{LF}asking all the girls to dance.
How did I do, you ask?{LF}I never got turned down once!
I sure was popular!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}When I was younger, I used go around{LF}asking all the girls to dance.
Today is the Fishing Contest.{LF}I'm more of a pro at eating fish,{LF}myself.
If you're participating,{LF}be sure to catch me a tasty fish!
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}You did it, ＠カイル＠＠!
That's too bad, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}But remember, humans aren't perfect.{LF}Don't let it get you down!
Today is the Big Cook-Off, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I'm more of a pro at eating, myself.
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}You did it, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I didn't know you had it in you!
That's too bad, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}But remember, us humans aren't perfect.{LF}Don't let it get you down!
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}I hope you're going to enter!{LF}A little adventure is good for{LF}the soul!
You did it, ＠カイル＠＠!
Ba ha ha ha!{LF}Are you upset about the contest?{LF}Don't worry about it.{LF}Just do your best next time!
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}I'm going to stay here and pray for{LF}everyone's safety.
You did it, ＠アルス＠＠!
I heard about the contest.{LF}Cheer up!{LF}Just do your best next time!
Today is the Harvest Festival.{LF}It's a time to give thanks for the{LF}bounty that nature provides us.
It's so easy to take these things{LF}for granted. That's why these{LF}festivals are so important.

Today is the Monster Contest.{LF}Monsters live in this world too,{LF}and we must treat them {LF}with humanity and compassion.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you did well today.
Ba ha ha, that's too bad,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I thought you handled{LF}yourself impressively.

You did well today.
Ba ha ha, that's too bad.{LF}I thought you handled yourself{LF}impressively.
Today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}All this talk about wishing upon a{LF}star is making me feel kinda romantic!
But even if you wish upon a star,{LF}you still need to work hard{LF}for your wishes to come true.

But even if you wish upon a star,{LF}you still need to work hard{LF}for your wishes to come true.
Today is the Mining Contest.{LF}Minerals have wondrous properties.{LF}If you wear one,{LF}it can lend you its strength.
I guess it might just{LF}be all in the mind, though.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Did you find anything interesting?{LF}It looks like you did well.
When I need any minerals,{LF}I'll be sure to ask for your help,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
That's rough, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}But it's hard to find something{LF}really special.{LF}That's why they're called special!
Don't worry about it.{LF}Just do your best next time.

It's the last day of the year.{LF}Lord, thank you for{LF}giving us another peaceful{LF}year in your divine mercy.
What are you doing,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You need to pray too.

Hi, ＠アルス＠＠! I've got a favor to{LF}ask you.
What is it, Gordon?
What is it, Gordon?
Could ya give this to Roy?
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Roy asked me to make him one of these.{LF}I've just finished it!
Sure thing! I'll give this to him!
Sure thing! I'll give this to him!
Thanks!
All right, I'm counting on you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I want you to deliver that{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Roy.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Okay, I gave it to Roy! He says{LF}thanks!
Okay, I gave it to Roy! He says{LF}thanks!
You delivered it for me?{LF}Thanks!
Here, have this.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks again! If I need anything{LF}else, I'll be sure to ask you!
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠!
This is about my request, right?{LF}I'd like to get right to it...
I want you to deliver this to Yue.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
It's a piece of jewelry I made for{LF}her.
Apparently, they're selling like{LF}hotcakes in other towns! Ga ha ha ha!
So, anyway, I need you to deliver{LF}this to Yue!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Please deliver that ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Yue for me.
Careful not to lose it!
Did you deliver it for me?{LF}Thanks!
Here, take this!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks again! If I need anything{LF}else, I'll be sure to ask you!
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I've got a favor to ask you.
Could you get my ＠アイテム９＠{LF}back from Cammy?
It seems she's really taken a liking{LF}to it, and she hasn't given it back{LF}to me yet.
The problem is, I can't make any of{LF}my jewelry without it.
She just won't listen to me,{LF}though... *sigh*... But it{LF}wouldn't be right for me to{LF}just go and steal it back!
Since you're both children, I{LF}was hoping she'd listen to you...
Thanks a lot, ＠アルス＠＠.
Get my ＠アイテム９＠ back{LF}from Cammy, please.
She won't listen to me, but I{LF}think she might if another{LF}child asked her.
Great! It looks like you brought{LF}it back in one piece! Could you{LF}give it back to me now?
Now that's done,{LF}here's your payment.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh, it looks like you're{LF}carrying too much.{LF}Could you straighten up your backpack?
Thanks! You've been a big help!
Thanks again.{LF}You've been a big help.
Thanks again.{LF}You've been a big help, as always.
Thanks again.{LF}I knew I could count on you.
Take good care of Dorothy.
Thanks.{LF}You've been a big help.
Thanks.{LF}You've been a big help.
Thanks.{LF}You've been a big help.
I'm going around town and making{LF}sure there aren't any problems.{LF}Is everything okay here?
I appreciate you {LF}looking after the town.{LF}I don't think I need {LF}anything here, though.
Gordon, I'm here about your{LF}request on the bulletin board.
Yes, sorry to bother you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Let me get right to it.{LF}I need an{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You can find it on{LF}Blessia Island.
Just run around busting up{LF}rocks around there, and{LF}it shouldn't take you too long.
Just run around...busting up rocks?
I wish I could do it myself, but...
There are lots of aggressive {LF}monsters there, right?
If I were to get attacked,{LF}I couldn't even defend myself.
That wouldn't be right of me.{LF}I'm a representative of God.{LF}Well, I am now, at least.
Don't worry, you'll be paid well.{LF}What do you think?
Just find one and bring it back to me.{LF}Do whatever it takes.
Well, within reason.{LF}Don't do anything that{LF}goes against God, of course.
Okay, leave it to me.
Oh, and before I forget,{LF}take my hammer.{LF}You'll need this to smash the rocks!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
To mine minerals,{LF}you need to use a hammer{LF}to smash apart rocks.{LF}It can be tiring, but keep at it!
Thanks, and good luck!
Hey, you're carrying too much right now.{LF}Make some room for it in your backpack.
It's just a hand-me-down,{LF}but it'll do the job well enough.{LF}Take my hammer.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, and good luck!
I need a{LF}＠アイテム９.
To find minerals, you need to go into{LF}one of the monster-infested areas and{LF}smash the rocks you find there with{LF}that hammer.
You should be able to find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ on{LF}Blessia Island.
Be careful out there!
Gordon,{LF}I'm here about your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
Oh, you saw that,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Okay, I need you to bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You should be able to find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}if you go to Trieste Forest.{LF}
I'd go myself, but I can't be{LF}away from the church.
Since there are monsters around there,{LF}it would be too dangerous {LF}to send Dorothy or Cammy.
So I thought I'd turn to you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
It should be easy for you.
You can leave it to me.
I knew I could count on you!
Well, be on your way, then.{LF}Be careful out there!
You should be able to find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}in Trieste Forest.
Just break whatever rocks you can find,{LF}and it shouldn't take long.{LF}Good luck.
Gordon,{LF}I'm here about your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
That was fast, ＠カイル＠＠.
Okay, I need you to bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You can sometimes find them on a{LF}＠モンスター９＠. You'll find them{LF}in Trieste Forest at night.
That means that you're going to have{LF}to fight for it.{LF}Of course, monsters don't die when{LF}they are defeated, but still...
I can't raise my fists against {LF}any creature.
That's why I need you to do it,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
...
Are you uncomfortable with that?
I know it seems like I just use my{LF}faith to get out of these difficult{LF}tasks.
Trust me, though, if I weren't a{LF}priest, I'd like nothing more than to{LF}get my hands dirty battling some{LF}monsters.
Unfortunately, priests are held to a{LF}higher standard. We must be good{LF}and pure to provide balance{LF}against the world's worst evils.
Yet not everyone can be as pure as a{LF}priest. Society requires most people{LF}to walk a path where they must make{LF}moral compromises to get things done.
The challenge, then, is to choose{LF}your compromises wisely..{LF}But I've started to sound preachy,{LF}and I digress.
This time, I'll pay you{LF}＠数字９＠G.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I know you can do this.{LF}I'm counting on your help.
But don't forget!{LF}Don't be inhumane.{LF}Always be just and {LF}compassionate in your deeds.
You should be able to find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ on of a ＠モンスター９＠.{LF}Look in Trieste Forest at night.{LF}
Good luck.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's good to see you.
By the way,{LF}I have a favor to ask of you.{LF}Could you bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠?
You should be able to find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}if you go to the Padova Mountains.
Thanks as always.
Find me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You should be able to find one{LF}in the Padova Mountains.
Thanks as always.
You've read the bulletin board,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
There's something I need to say to you.{LF}It's about Dorothy...
You probably already know, but...
My daughter...Dorothy. She's had a{LF}shadow, a darkness, over her heart.{LF}It's a good heart, but she's always{LF}kept it hidden from others.
As her father, I've always tried{LF}to be her strength, her cornerstone.
But I could never free her heart from{LF}that shadow.
But you, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}Thanks to you, I think Dorothy has{LF}finally been able to bring her heart{LF}into the light and let others see it.
I don't know what you did.
But I do know that ever since you{LF}started talking to her, my daughter{LF}has become an almost completely{LF}different person.
You've been able to do what I,{LF}her own father, couldn't.
And I thank you from the bottom{LF}of my heart.
You were able to open up {LF}her heart, so I...
I would be proud to call you my son.{LF}You may marry my daughter{LF}with my full blessing.
Of course, it's up to you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I won't make you marry my daughter{LF}if you don't want to.
But if you choose to...{LF}I've been working hard on a special{LF}pendant for my daughter.
I've blessed it with holy rites,{LF}and I have filled it with the power{LF}to protect her from disasters.
Everything I've had you bring me{LF}has been for that pendant.
I was hoping that it would help her{LF}to feel safe enough that she'd open{LF}up to people.{LF}
It was the only thing left that I{LF}could think of.
But it looks like it wasn't what{LF}she needed to open up after all...
I want you to have it, ＠カイル＠＠.
You have been a greater source{LF}of strength for Dorothy than I{LF}could ever be.
If you give this to her, I believe{LF}it will mean more to her than it{LF}would if I gave it to her.
Please, take it.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
You can do with it as you wish.
I have only one thing to ask of you.{LF}Don't do anything to hurt Dorothy.
Ah, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much stuff! Clear up some space{LF}in your backpack!
Spring makes you feel like making a{LF}fresh start, don't you think?
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival.{LF}There's a really fun party.
When I am having fun, I like to go all out.{LF}That's my belief, anyway.{LF}If you don't enjoy yourself,{LF}you'll be missing out.
Are you all right? {LF}There was an earthquake.{LF}I'm fine, as you can see,{LF}but I'm worried about everyone else.
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest.{LF}Since I'm entering in it, you're {LF}going to have a hard time winning, but{LF}it might be fun for you to try!
Summer starts tomorrow, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I love the sea in summer. Looking out{LF}at the sea, all my troubles seem to{LF}wash away.
And there's plenty of delicious fish!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Tomorrow is the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. If a monster starts{LF}causing trouble, I might have to do{LF}something.
You'll have to forgive me{LF}if I send it running back to{LF}the Forest of Beginnings.
Another earthquake...{LF}It seems like I should get some sort of sign{LF}before they strike. I am the town priest,{LF}after all. Is a little divine warning so{LF}much to ask for?
It's gotten hot out lately.{LF}These robes don't help any, either.
But they are the vestments of my{LF}faith! Nobody respects a preacher{LF}in his boxer shorts!
Tomorrow is the Dance Festival.{LF}So go out there and have some fun!{LF}It's important to make good memories{LF}when you're young.
Tomorrow is the Fishing Contest.{LF}I don't fish, myself, but I think{LF}you should give it a try.
Tomorrow is the Adventure Contest.{LF}Who doesn't get excited at the prospect{LF}of a little adventure, eh?{LF}I hope you'll be participating!
Another earthquake...{LF}There've been a lot of those.{LF}I've got a real bad feeling...
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival.{LF}It's time to give our thanks to the{LF}earth for the bounty it provides us.
Don't ever forget to be thankful {LF}for life's gifts, ＠カイル＠＠!
It's already fall.{LF}The leaves are beautiful...
This season is a time for{LF}all things delicious.{LF}Delicious food and delicious drinks... {LF}That's the best!
Tomorrow is the Monster Contest.{LF}If you're going to enter it,{LF}you'd better do well.
A wish carried upon a star... {LF}It's a romantic thought.{LF}Tomorrow is the Shooting Star Festival.
I don't know who came up{LF}with that idea, but don't forget{LF}to pray to God, too!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
Brrr...It's gotten cold lately.{LF}How are you feeling, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}There's nothing that can warm you{LF}up like a nice stiff drink.
Tomorrow is the Mining Contest.{LF}I'm interested in minerals, myself.
If you find anything special,{LF}be sure to show me.
Another earthquake?{LF}Is everyone okay?
Don't worry about me.{LF}Please, just hurry and{LF}check on everyone else.
It's the end of another year.{LF}How was this last year for you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Spring makes you feel like making a{LF}fresh start, don't you think?
It's gotten hot out lately.{LF}This robes don't help any, either.
But they are a part of my faith!{LF}I cannot take them off!
It's already fall.{LF}The leaves are beautiful... 
This season is a time for{LF}all things delicious.{LF}Delicious food and delicious drinks... {LF}That's the best!
Looking out at the snowy winter{LF}landscape, one can feel the true{LF}divinity within nature.{LF}You might be too young to understand.
Do you like living in this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What do you think of this town?{LF}It's nice, isn't it?
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I hope you can get used{LF}to living here too.
You're up and about early.{LF}Be sure to eat a nice big{LF}breakfast before you start the day.
How are you doing, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Don't push yourself too hard.
Even at this hour, {LF}you look full of energy.{LF}You're not staying up too late,{LF}are you?
I really like a good {LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}But I always eat too much of it!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!

Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I bet you've made good friends already.
I'm glad you're getting to know{LF}Dorothy better,{LF}but if you try anything funny{LF}I'm not going to let you off easily.
Ba ha ha ha!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I bet you've made good friends already.
I'm glad you're getting to know{LF}Dorothy better,{LF}but if you try anything funny{LF}I'm not going to let you off easily.
Ba ha ha ha!
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you made any friends?{LF}You should get to know{LF}my daughter, Dorothy.
Just don't get any ideas.{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
It's easy to take it for granted {LF}after living here so long, but {LF}it's truly a blessing to have such a {LF}beautiful view of the sea every day.
Even though it comes with having{LF}storms so bad that we can't step{LF}outside.
I wouldn't even think about{LF}going outside during a storm.{LF}The sea can rise up and{LF}flood the whole town!
It's very dangerous.{LF}You should wait indoors{LF}for the storm to die down.
As the priest in this town,{LF}I talk with a lot of people.{LF}I get to hear a lot {LF}of interesting things.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You look happy today!
You look like you're in{LF}a good mood today, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
People who smile all the time{LF}are truly blessed.
What is it, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Did something good happen to you {LF}recently?
If you've had something good{LF}happen to you, be sure to pass{LF}it on to someone else. That way,{LF}you can help happiness spread!
It's always nice to get another{LF}＠アイテム８＠{LF}for my collection.
It just has such a good ring to it.{LF}It's almost like it cleanses the soul.

By the way, {LF}what do you think of my vestments?{LF}Aren't they something?
Priests are always wearing holy robes.{LF}Just by putting them on,{LF}they can completely change how I feel.

Dorothy can be quiet and tends {LF}to have a dark view of things,{LF}but the truth is, she's a good child,{LF}and she's kind to everyone she meets.
I'm her father, so I would know.
There's a rumor that I used to do battle{LF}as one of the King's knights.{LF}I've never been able to figure{LF}out how that got around.
Whenever I meet someone new,{LF}they tend to be scared,{LF}and won't come near me...
I wish Dorothy could get{LF}used to talking to other people...
She's a good kid,{LF}when she opens up,{LF}but she has a tendency{LF}to stay withdrawn...
I don't handle Woolies well.
I'm embarrassed to say it,{LF}but I'm allergic to Woolies.
Just looking at a{LF}＠アイテム７＠ gives me a{LF}rash. So if you ever give me one,{LF}expect some divine wrath!

There's one thing that can be said for{LF}absolutely everyone - they have a{LF}birthday.
You may not be able to remember it, but {LF}you have a birthday, too.
A birthday also offers a good chance to{LF}look back over your life and consider {LF}where you are headed.
While we're on the subject, my birthday{LF}is 15th of Fall. Don't you think it's {LF}interesting, people and their birthdays?

Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I always look forward to getting my {LF}teeth on your latest crop of {LF}produce.
Cammy hates veggies, though. I just{LF}can't get her to eat them. I really {LF}don't know what to do!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I always look forward to getting my {LF}teeth on your latest crop of {LF}produce.
Just keep on growing them like you've{LF}been growing them!
Cammy hated vegetables, but it's the{LF}most amazing thing. She'll eat the ones {LF}from your field, even though she still {LF}says she doesn't like them!
You have my thanks, as a parent.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How are things in the field?
Your crops are all the rage in our{LF}house.
Well, aside from with Cammy!{LF}Hah hah hah hah!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It looks like you've really taken to{LF}working in the fields.
You don't look built for it, to be{LF}honest, and I wasn't sure you'd last.
But it looks like my worries {LF}were misplaced! I'm glad.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}The produce from your field is top- {LF}quality stuff. You've got a green{LF}thumb for sure!
Memory can be a funny thing, can't it?{LF}You'll remember the smallest detail for {LF}years...
But forget important errands you {LF}planned to do just yesterday!
Then there are people like you{LF}who have totally lost their memories.
But, in general, people remember{LF}their happy memories.
So maybe there's some reason that{LF}you forgot your past. Maybe you{LF}wanted to.
But I can't say if that's a good thing {LF}or not, really.
I've been thinking, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}When your memory finally comes back...
I wonder what will happen to the{LF}memories you've made in the meantime. I {LF}hope you don't forget everything that's {LF}happened here in our town!
I've got something important to tell{LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You can't just kill something because{LF}you don't like it.
You must treat all animals with respect.{LF}That is what God teaches us.
It seems we have a family of mice {LF}living in the church roof.
Dorothy is really scared of them,{LF}can't stand the poor creatures.
But the mice are just living their {LF}lives, just like us. I wouldn't dream of {LF}trying to evict them from their home.
It seems we have a family of mice{LF}living in the church roof.
Dorothy is really scared of them,{LF}can't stand the poor creatures.
We're all God's creatures, so why can't{LF}we all live under the same roof? I'm {LF}sure Dorothy won't see it like that, of {LF}course!
Gah hah hah hah hah!
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Is there anything you want to become in{LF}the future?
If you haven't decided yet, or you want{LF}some advice, you can talk to me about it {LF}any time.
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Is there anything you want to become in{LF}the future?
If you haven't decided yet, or you want{LF}some advice, you can talk to me about it {LF}any time.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}are you planning on continuing to work {LF}in the fields?
You make some pretty tasty stuff out{LF}there, and I personally hope you'll keep {LF}on doing it for years to come!
About Dorothy... I wish there was some{LF}way to help her be less shy.
Especially when talking to boys... {LF}but I just don't know what to do.
About Dorothy... I wish there was some{LF}way to help her be less shy.
She's a marriageable age now, too!{LF}She should be out meeting people!
About Dorothy... I wish there was some{LF}way to help her be less shy.
On the other hand, her younger sister{LF}Cammy is totally wild. I wish she'd calm {LF}down a little more! Man, two daughters {LF}can be hard work.
My Dorothy is so quiet, she hardly ever{LF}fights with her sister.
My Dorothy is so quiet, she hardly ever{LF}fights with her sister.
Although I hear Cammy has been fighting {LF}with Roy a lot recently! Gah hah hah {LF}hah!
My Dorothy is so quiet, she hardly ever{LF}fights with her sister.
I don't think I've ever seen her get{LF}angry.
Let us hope that out town shall{LF}remain at peace, and that all living {LF}here shall remain healthy for another {LF}day.
You were really nervous during your{LF}wedding, weren't you? I had to work hard {LF}to keep myself from laughing!{LF}Gah hah hah hah!
Everything is well again today,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. Let us thank God{LF}for our daily peace.
We must always remain grateful!
You were really nervous during your{LF}wedding, weren't you? I had to work hard {LF}to keep myself from laughing!{LF}Gah hah hah hah!
God, thank you for our blessed peace {LF}again today.
You were really nervous during your{LF}wedding, weren't you? I had to work hard {LF}to keep myself from laughing!{LF}Gah hah hah hah!
Hey, you look cheerful today. Wish I{LF}could say the same...I had a little too {LF}much to drink yesterday!
I need to exercise a little more self{LF}control!
But why does it have to feel so bad the {LF}day afterward?
Gah hah hah hah! Just another day that{LF}we men can experience, I suppose!
Drinking a little at night is a form of{LF}purification of the body. A fine,{LF}traditional ceremony for purification.
You see? I don't just drink for the sake {LF}of it. There is a reason!
Have you ever heard of the Forest of{LF}Beginnings? 
All of the monsters originate from{LF}there, and that's where defeated {LF}monsters return to.
Those that I had no choice but to see{LF}off must be back there, now, too.
Have you ever heard of the Forest of{LF}Beginnings? 
Monsters return there after they are{LF}defeated. How many have I sent back? {LF}That's a secret! Gah hah hah hah!
Have you ever heard of the Forest of{LF}Beginnings? 
It's a forest were monsters live.{LF}I wouldn't fancy going anywhere near{LF}the place.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You've been here a while now, so maybe{LF}you've started to notice things in town{LF}that you aren't entirely happy with?
If you don't feel like you can talk to{LF}the mayor directly then you can always {LF}come and talk to me. I'll pass your {LF}comments on.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You've been here a while now, so maybe{LF}you've started to notice things in town{LF}that you aren't entirely happy with?
Simply keeping things like that to{LF}yourself isn't going to solve anything.
There aren't many people here in town,{LF}so whenever there's a get together its {LF}always just the same folk!
Not that drinking with them isn't a{LF}bundle of fun, of course! Gah hah hah!
You know, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}all that produce from your fields{LF}wouldn't be possible without the power{LF}of the earth.
Never forget this fact, and always{LF}remain thankful to the earth. The{LF}earth does not reward those who do{LF}not show it the proper respect.

You work with the earth every day,{LF}don't you, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You know how great the power of the{LF}earth is then, don't you?
You see the strength and power that{LF}plants take from the soil.{LF}You can never forget this power, and {LF}always remain thankful to the Earth. 
The earth does not reward those who{LF}do not show it the proper respect.
Have you heard of the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They're legendary dragons, and they're fearsomely powerful.
Some regions even worship the Elder{LF}Dragons as gods. Pretty interesting, {LF}don't you think?
Have you heard of the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They're legendary dragons, and they're{LF}fearsomely powerful. Even if you {LF}ever get a chance to take one on, I {LF}wouldn't recommend it!
Although...that's never going to {LF}happen, is it? Gah hah hah hah!
Have you heard of the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They're legendary dragons, and they're{LF}fearsomely powerful. If a monster {LF}like that ever turned up...yeah, we'd {LF}be finished.
I don't even want to think about it!
You've done so much for us since you{LF}arrived here.
You're a fine young man. A blessing,{LF}and no mistake! I'm grateful{LF}for you, ＠カイル＠＠!
I've heard that you've been helping folk {LF}out around town, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm impressed! Truly, you live{LF}by the rule of doing unto others as{LF}you would have others do unto you.
I'm sure your kindness will be repaid.{LF}Keep it up, lad!
You've been good to the town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. You've really{LF}helped me out, too. You're a fine young{LF}man. I'm sure you will be rewarded!
You'll always have my gratitude,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
You're just like your father,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, always so full{LF}of energy! Not quite as much{LF}energy as my Cammy, but still!
How's school? Fun? Cammy is always {LF}complaining about how hard the lessons {LF}are! Gah hah hah hah!
Places with monsters are dangerous,{LF}okay? You stay away from them!
Although, I can't expect you to{LF}listen to me when even Cammy sneaks{LF}off sometimes! But I don't want you{LF}copying her, you hear?
Working in the fields is hard, isn't it?{LF}Your father used to work really hard, {LF}too.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠. I hear you've been{LF}helping Cammy out. Thanks. Keep an eye {LF}on her for me, would you?
What brings you to the clinic? Not an{LF}injury, I hope! There's only one reason {LF}I come here. To drink! Gah hah hah hah!
What brings you to the clinic? Not an{LF}injury, I hope! There's only one reason {LF}I come here. To drink! Gah hah hah hah!

Gah hah hah hah! This sure tastes good!

Gah hah hah hah! This sure tastes good!
Gah hah hah hah! This sure tastes good!
Hey, you want to buy anything?
Hey, you want to buy anything?
Hey, you want to buy anything?
Hey, you want to buy anything?
Look at all these lovely flowers, all{LF}around here. Man, it makes me want to {LF}have a drink!
Summer has always been hot. Rather than{LF}complain, you'd be better off thinking {LF}of ways to enjoy the heat. Gah hah hah {LF}hah!
The west side of the town of a pretty{LF}clam, relaxing place.
Snow covering everything, white and{LF}crisp! Just be careful not to catch a {LF}cold out there!
People are always passing by here. If{LF}you want to hear the latest gossip, just {LF}stand here and it'll come right to you!
You can't shut yourself up inside,{LF}just because it's hot out.
There are always people hanging around{LF}here. When people have free time, they {LF}often spend it here.
A layer of snow really calms the town{LF}down, doesn't it.
You're here for soak too, are you?{LF}I love the big baths here!{LF}Gah hah hah hah!
A steaming hot bath is best in summer! {LF}It feels so good when you finally climb {LF}out!
Gah hah hah hah!
I've even seen Cammy start to swim in{LF}the bath, if it's big enough! She just {LF}doesn't listen to a word I say!
She's a real handful of a daughter!{LF}Gah hah hah hah!
The best thing about the baths here is{LF}that you can just jump right into them,{LF}＠アルス＠＠! Give it a try,{LF}come on!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠, my child.{LF}Are you here to listen to one of my {LF}sermons? Excellent. Then let me begin... 
I'm just kidding. You're still a{LF}little too young to sit still for two{LF}hours, I think!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠, my child.{LF}Are you here to listen to one of my {LF}sermons? Excellent. Then let me begin...

Ah, here looking for Cammy, are you?
Ah, here looking for Cammy, are you?
Ah, here looking for Cammy, are you?
Ah, here looking for Cammy, are you?
You've really grown up recently,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. As though you've{LF}overcome a powerful foe... But no, that{LF}can't be it! Gah hah hah hah!
Don't tell me, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}you've been fighting monsters...?{LF}You'd better not have been!
Those monsters will gobble a little{LF}thing like you right up!
You're not going near any monster-{LF}infested areas, are you? Cammy has been{LF}acting a little odd recently, but maybe{LF}it's just my imagination.
Just don't do anything dangerous out {LF}there, okay?
Hey. You've really grown up recently.{LF}Has something happened?
Ga ha ha! So ＠カイル＠＠ came back,{LF}did he? Great news, eh, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I knew he had the heart of a warrior{LF}in him!
Looking good, ＠カイル＠＠!
Looking good, ＠アルス＠＠!
Is that...that for more? Th-Thanks!
Ah! D-D-Do you want...something...?
Hey, um, don't be scared.{LF}I don't bite!
I brought this for you.
Oh...this is... Well, th-thank you.
No problem. Be careful not to lose it{LF}again! 
Ah! H-hold on...{LF}Pl-Please, here, take this.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you! But really, there's no need{LF}for this... 
Is that...really, is th-that for me?{LF}Th-thank you... 
Thanks... Thank you for f-finding this{LF}for me... 
Ah...＠カイル＠＠... {LF}Well...Fern says thanks, too... 
Huh? Who? You mean...your doll?
Y-Yes...please...take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I hate...to well, ask th-this, but... {LF}could you make some room in your{LF}ba-backpack, first?
Is that...really, is th-that for me?{LF}Th-thank you... 
Dorothy, I've got a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}here for you.
Th-thank you...Now Fern can {LF}get better... 
I-Isn't that good news, Fern? {LF}Th-Thank ＠カイル＠＠ too, okay?
Fern says...thank you too.
This is...j-just a little something.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I hope it helps you out in the fields... 
I've...I've got some wood here, too... {LF}Please, i-if you can use it... 
You got 100 pieces of wood!
Thank you, Dorothy. I'm glad you'll be{LF}okay now, too, Fern. If you need my {LF}help again, just ask!
I will... 
I hate...to well, ask th-this, but...{LF}could you make some room in your{LF}ba-backpack, first?
Is that...really, is th-that for me?{LF}Th-thank you... 
Oh... This...This is my...?
That's right. You dropped this, didn't{LF}you, Dorothy? Barrett told me to bring{LF}it back to you.
Yeah...yeah, th-thank you... And... {LF}thank Barrett for me... 
I will. See you again soon, Dorothy.
Okay... 
Here, Dorothy, I want you to have{LF}this pendant.
This...just what...what is this...?
This pendant has the power to protect{LF}you from any and all misfortune, {LF}Dorothy.
I really want you to have it.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}Th-Thank you...I'm very happy... 
There's something that's been... {LF}worrying me. I feel...st-strange, when {LF}you're around, ＠カイル＠＠.
Strange how, exactly...?
Like...my heart suddenly starts beating {LF}fast... 
Hmmmm... 
Everything suddenly goes white... 
Hmmmm...
My throat suddenly goes dry... 
It's like...I'm about to fall apart...!
Is there anything I can do to help?
I don't know... I don't know if{LF}anything can help me with this{LF}feeling...
So it's incurable, is it?
Dorothy, I think I know something that{LF}will help.
...!
Dorothy... 
...will you marry me?
...try holding your breath.
...will you marry me?
!!!
If you're always around me, I'm sure{LF}you'll be able to overcome this. That's {LF}the only treatment I can think of.
Oh...＠カイル＠＠...!
I know we'll be happy together.
Y-Yes...!
＠カイル＠＠... 
I love you!
How about trying to hold your breath?
I think I'll just pass out... 
You're right...sorry... 
Here, you can...have this back... 
I'm, well, sorry... {LF}I'm not ready for this... 
S-Sorry...!
The ＠アイテム９＠ was{LF}returned to you.
A present for me...? Th-Thank you... 
Is that...really, is th-that for me?{LF}Th-thank you... 
Thank you...!
However, I still need ＠数字８＠{LF}more... Remember, I need a{LF}total of five!
That should be enough...{LF}Thanks for your help! 
Here's a little thank you for{LF}your hard work!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You're really are a good kid,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, your backpack is full.{LF}Can you make some room first...?
Oh...that's for me? Thank you.

Mayor Byron asked me to bring{LF}it to you.
Mayor Byron asked me to bring{LF}it to you.
Really? Thank you so much...{LF}I use this to make medicine,{LF}but I just ran out.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, your backpack is full.{LF}Can you make some room first...?
Oh...that's for me? Thank you.
Oh, what's this for?
Cammy asked me to bring this to you.{LF}She made it herself!
Cammy asked me to bring this to you.{LF}She made it herself!
She said she was too embarrassed to{LF}give it to you in person.
She said she was too embarrassed to{LF}give it to you in person.
Oh, Cammy... This is so nice!{LF}And you say she made it herself?{LF}Please tell her thank you for me.
And thank you too, ＠アルス＠＠.
No problem!
No problem!
That...that's for me...? I really... {LF}really like ＠アイテム９＠... 
How beautiful... {LF}＠アイテム８＠ are my... {LF}favorite flower...Th-thank you...
Uwah....! Why...why for me...?
This is the kind of thing...the kind of{LF}thing that Cammy would prefer, I {LF}think... 
That's for me?{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
How beautiful. ＠アイテム８＠ are my{LF}favorite flower. Thank you!
Uwah....! Why...why for me...?
This is the kind of thing that Cammy{LF}would prefer. Why not give it to her?
Dorothy, please drink this.
Eh...ah...okay... 
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠...!{LF}What can I say?
Please, don't look at me like that... {LF}You're embarrassing me!
Dorothy, please drink this.
Eh...ah...okay... 
Can I...just say, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}Thank you so much for...always being so{LF}kind to me.
Here, you can have this.
Here, you can have this.
Wow...thanks!
You're a good kid, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You always cheer me up!
Thank you...I'd love to get this for my {LF}birthday... 
Thank you...I'd love to get this for my {LF}birthday... 
A birthday present...for me?{LF}Thank you!
A birthday present, for me?{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
I...I can't ask for more than one{LF}present, can I... 
One present is quite enough, but thank{LF}you.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is that a present for me...?
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
A present for me...? Th-Thank you...
You're not...feeling ill? Or tired?
Take care...that this heat do-doesn't{LF}wear you out, okay...?
It's...easy to fall sick in fall.{LF}No pun...in-intended...
You need to...dress up warm, okay...?
Are you...here to buy something?
Are you...here to buy something?
Are you...here to buy something?
Are you...here to buy something?
It's been warm recently. I like warm {LF}weather... 
I prefer the heat to the cold... 
Fall is a time of harvest...have you{LF}done well this year...?
I have poor circulation, so winter is... {LF}hard for me... 
This...this is a coincidence,{LF}isn't it?
Are you...well...?
Nice weather we're having...{LF}isn't it.
Just...be careful not to sl-slip{LF}and fall...okay...?
I thought I might...put a note up on{LF}the bulletin board...but maybe not... 
This is the place to meet people,{LF}isn't it... 
But...I don't like being around too {LF}many pl-people at once... 
Snow has fallen, and my heart and mind{LF}are...at peace.
This...this is a coincidence,{LF}isn't it?
Are you...well...?
Nice weather we're having... {LF}isn't it.
Just...be careful not to sl-slip{LF}and fall...okay...?
That's...a lovely breeze, isn't it... 
Really...calming here, isn't it... 
A cool breeze... 
It's...a little co-cold here, for me... 
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You come here too, do you?
What...what a coincidence, meeting {LF}you here... 
Well...it's quiet, so I come here{LF}quite often... 
Well...it's quiet, so it really{LF}soothes me... 
Are you...here to take a ba-bath?
Then you need to go to the...{LF}me-men's bath, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}No peeking now.
I do love to take a bath.
You need to...be quiet in the{LF}public bath. Don't cause a{LF}di-disturbance for anyone...
Um... D-Do you need something...?
Um... Did you want something at the{LF}church?
Is there...anything I can help you{LF}with...?
Well...my father does like the sound{LF}of his own voice... 
Um...Well, th-this is my room... 
I...I guess you can s-see that{LF}for yourself, though...can't{LF}you...?
Do you want something?{LF}Coming all the way here... 
Cammy... {LF}I wish she wouldn't mess up my room... 
She just messes things up and then {LF}leaves. I don't know what to do... 
I'm sorry...you've come to see me,{LF}and look at the state of this place.
You're an example to us all, the hard{LF}work you do.
Don't overdo it now.
Fall is a great time for tasty produce.
The fields look so bleak in winter,{LF}don't they.
Hello, h-honey.
I'm...a little embarrassed to call{LF}you that, actually... 
I'm very...very happy to have{LF}married you.
I'll love you forever.
I hope we have a baby soon!{LF}Don't you hope so, honey?
You just concentrate on making the{LF}fields bloom! Leave the housework to me.
I've changed...all thanks to you.{LF}I love you, honey.
Don't overdo things, please.{LF}I'm very worried about you.
I haven't been feeling so good{LF}recently...especially in the mornings.
Are you okay?{LF}Sounds a little worrying.
I'll be fine, I'm sure.{LF}But thank you...for worrying about me.
Let's just carry on making lots of{LF}memories together.
I wonder what our baby will look like.{LF}I can't wait!|
Good luck with building the school!{LF}I'm backing you all the way.
Try talking to Mayor Byron when he's on{LF}the first floor of his house.
I hope you can start on the school soon!
Today is the day the school will be{LF}completed! I can't wait to see it!
Da-Darling... {LF}I have something important to say.
What?
It looks like...I'm pregnant.
Re-really?! Great! Wow, I'm so happy,{LF}Dorothy.
I'm happy too!
Our baby...wow, that's amazing!{LF}I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl?
Which are you hoping for?
A boy
A girl
I'm happy with either!
I'd like a boy, I think.{LF}What about you, Dorothy?
I'd like a girl, I think.{LF}What about you, Dorothy?
I'd be happy with either!{LF}What about you, Dorothy?
Oh, the same as you!|
Great! Our own family is going to start!
That's right! Keep up your hard work,{LF}darling, for the sake of our child, too.
Of course I will! I've got two to{LF}support now!
Our baby is going to be born soon!
Darling, our baby has been born!
Well done, Dorothy! I'm so happy!
Look. A son! He takes after you!
Look. A daughter! She takes after you!
Wonderful!
We need to think of a name. The perfect,{LF}most wonderful name!
 ＠アルス＠＠...?{LF}That's great.{LF}A really lovely name!
Good.
 ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You need to eat plenty to grow up{LF}healthy and strong!
Growing up...
What is it?
I was just thinking how badly we{LF}need that school.
The school... yeah, you're right.
Now our baby has been born, I'll try{LF}talking to Mayor Byron about building one.
It will be wonderful if you can do it!{LF}And I know you can.{LF}For ＠アルス＠＠, too.
Yes!
What a coincidence, meeting you here{LF}＠カイル＠＠... 
If you are going to be around any{LF}monsters, please...be careful.
You'd better not go any further than{LF}this. It's dangerous in there.
Trieste Forest is warm, even in winter.{LF}I just hope there aren't any monsters... 
Dorothy, sorry to keep you waiting.
You came, ＠カイル＠＠... 
Let's move to a spot where we can see{LF}better.
Do you think we'll...{LF}see some shooting stars...?
I'm getting quite excited, actually!
Me too... 
Ah! There! Oh, how beautiful...
Just for an instant, I saw one!
Shooting stars are so...mysterious,{LF}aren't they...! So beautiful... 
It's strange. Why do we find them so{LF}beautiful, do you think?
Oh, another one!
How lovely... 
Really lovely.
I'm...so glad to have seen this with{LF}you...＠カイル＠＠.
I'll treasure this memory...forever.
I'm glad to have seen this with you,{LF}too, Dorothy.
It's starting to cool down,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, isn't it... 
I have poor circulation... {LF}It means I don't like the cold.
Ah, then shall we head back? We wouldn't{LF}watch to catch cold, either, would we?
No, of course not... 
Thank you...for today. I was very happy {LF}to be invited by you... 
And I was happy to invite you, Dorothy. {LF}I'll see you soon, I hope.
Yes...good night, ＠カイル＠＠.
Ah... Um... G-Goodbye!
Whoa, hey, hold on! Why are you{LF}running away? I'm not that scary,{LF}am I?
Um... Well... I...I...haven't{LF}really talked to boys before... 
It's okay. I understand. My name{LF}is ＠カイル＠＠. What's your name?
M-My name...? Well...it's...{LF}It's... Goodbye!
Goodbye? That's quite a unique{LF}name! Seriously, though, just{LF}relax, and say your name...
R-Relax... O-Okay... {LF}M-My name's...Dorothy... 
Nice to meet you, Dorothy.
Y-Yes... Nice...to meet you...too...{LF}G-Goodbye!
(Man, she is one shy girl...)
Good morning... 
H-Hello... 
G-Good...evening... 
G-Good...morning, ＠カイル＠＠. 
H-Hello...＠カイル＠＠.

Ah, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}g-good...evening.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm...happy to see you again today... 
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm...happy to see you again today... 
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm...happy to see you again today... 
Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
You look cheerful today!
Good evening.
Happy...Ha-Happy new year... 
Happy new year, ＠アルス＠＠.

Dorothy... 
Want to go look at the flowers with me?
Do you like cherry blossoms too?
Today...we're going to see all the{LF}flowers blooming...at the Flower{LF}Festival. I...I like flowers... 
Dorothy, would you care to go and look{LF}at the flowers with me?
Ah...that's...that's very sudden... {LF}What sh-should I say...
Ah, well...yes...I would...
Well, I think...the flowers in{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}are meant to be...{LF}very beautiful.
So...let's meet up in {LF}＠マップ９＠,{LF}shall we...?
Well...you see...I don't think, I{LF}mean...that you should...be asking so {LF}many girls...
Of course, I like cherry blossoms too... {LF}I hope you will grow to like them too,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...

Oh...congratulations on your victory...
Don't...Don't take it too hard...
It's the Monster Taming Contest today,{LF}isn't it...monsters are dangerous {LF}creatures!
That was amazing, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're taking more and more after your {LF}father every day.
That was a shame... {LF}Don't push yourself too hard, okay?
It's the Dance Festival today...{LF}You know, ＠カイル＠＠... Um... {LF}It's nothing...
Would you like to dance with me?
Well, I should be going.
What...?! You want to dance...with{LF}me...?
Yes...I would love that...
I'm...well...not much of a dancer...{LF}Sorry!
Anyway...see you...
Thank you...for today, I mean...
It was...fun... A lot of fun.
Ah...I'm sorry...
Did you have fun?

That was amazing.{LF}I'm...very impressed...
Not...really your thing, is it...?

It's the Adventure Contest today... {LF}This one always causes a lot of {LF}injuries. I hope people don't get too {LF}carried away, is all...
That was amazing, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're so small, yet so powerful!

It's the Harvest Festival today... Give{LF}thanks for the blessings of the earth...

Well done, out there.{LF}Please, tell your monsters too...
It's the Monster Contest today, isn't{LF}it... I'm not sure I want to see those {LF}scary monsters...
Congratulations, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}I may not like monsters much, but you{LF}were fantastic...
That was a shame...
It's the Shooting Star Festival{LF}tonight...
Would you like to see the stars with me?
Well...no, thank you anyway.
What...?! Yes! I'd love to...!
Well, then...tonight, at 9... I'll be{LF}waiting in {LF}＠マップ９＠...
I'm sorry.
Okay, then.

Tonight, at 9... I'll be waiting in{LF}＠マップ９＠...
I'm sorry...I can't.
Today was fun...!

I love...the mystery of shooting{LF}stars...!
It's the Shooting Star Festival{LF}tonight... Aren't shooting stars {LF}beautiful?
It's the Mining Contest today...
Well done, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I thought you'd do it.
That was a shame.{LF}There's always next time, okay?
Today is the Mining Contest...{LF}It involves going into{LF}monster-infested areas,{LF}so be careful...
Congratulations, ＠アルス＠＠...
That didn't go well, did it... Was the{LF}hammer too heavy for you?
The last day of the year...
The last day of the year...
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}You've been a big help.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}You've been a big help.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}You've been a big help.

Thank you very much...{LF}Fern is saying thank you, too...
Thank you...for coming along with me.{LF}You're a g-good person,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...

There's a lot I could learn from you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
I'll...bring more for you.
I'll be waiting.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}You've given me strength...
I'm just patrolling the town. Anything{LF}out of the ordinary to report, Dorothy?
Anything...out of the ordinary...?{LF}I don't think so...
Good luck with the patrol...
Ah... Thank you for coming...
I've got a request for you, actually...
I want you to take this{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Julia.
Don't drop it on the way, now!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Okay! No problem!
Okay! No problem!

I saw the bulletin board!
I saw the bulletin board!
Ah... So that's why you're here.{LF}Great...!
Okay, so...I'm about to run out of my{LF}supply of ＠アイテム９＠S...
If it's not too much trouble,{LF}could you collect five{LF}＠アイテム９＠S for me?

You're a great kid, ＠アルス＠＠...
Oh, your backpack is full.{LF}Can you make some room first...?
Ah...can I help you with anything...?
Ah...I saw your note{LF}on the bulletin board.
Oh...you saw that? Oh, my AMULET...{LF}Uh...never mind. It's nothing... {LF}Goodbye!
Hey, wait! Wait a minute! Did you find{LF}what you lost...? Oh, she's gone.
An ＠アイテム９＠? Hm...{LF}I'll bet she misses it, so I{LF}should find it and return it to her.
Where to look, though? Hmm...
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What are you doing?
Hello! I'm looking for something that{LF}Dorothy lost.
Oh, I see.
It may be around the docks.{LF}Have you looked there yet?
I saw her heading toward there, alone,{LF}a minute ago.
I see... Yes, she may have lost{LF}it there!
Thank you! I'll go and take a look right{LF}away!
I hope you find it.
Kyaaah! Ah...I'm sorry...
...
(Oh boy...)
(Just like Rosalind said, the docks too{LF}sound like a likely place...)
(I guess I should go and try them{LF}out...)
(Now to give her ＠アイテム９＠...)
Are you here about...{LF}the bulletin board?
Yes. You dropped something, right?{LF}I thought I'd help you search.
Ah...well... {LF}about the bulletin board...that's{LF}all taken care of now... G-Goodbye...
Hold on a moment.{LF}Did you find what you lost?
Ah, well...no...not yet... {LF}But it's okay...
No it isn't! Surely you want to get it{LF}back, don't you? I'll help you search!
Eh? Ah, well...that's...very nice of {LF}you...
A ＠アイテム９＠, right?{LF}Any idea where you dropped it?
Well...I think...it may have been in{LF}Trieste Forest.
Trieste Forest? What where you doing{LF}in such a dangerous place?
...
Well, anyway. I'll take a look in{LF}Trieste Forest for you. Don't worry.{LF}If it's there, I'll find it.
Ah...th-thank you...
Any idea where you dropped the{LF}＠アイテム９＠, then?
Well...I think...it may have been in{LF}Trieste Forest.
Trieste Forest? What where you doing{LF}in such a dangerous place?
...
(Okay, not I just need to give her{LF}＠アイテム９＠...)
Ah...hello,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I think Fern...has got a fever...
So...I need a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}from a ＠モンスター９＠...
Fern? That doll of yours, Dorothy?
Y-Yes...
She's got...a fever... So...
Ah! Maybe...the cotton inside the doll{LF}is rubbing together, creating friction {LF}and heat...?
...
I'm sorry, you didn't want to hear that{LF}sort of analysis, did you?
So I just have to defeat a{LF}＠モンスター９＠ and get the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ it drops?
Th-That's right...
Thank you...
Ah, the ＠モンスター９＠ monsters {LF}appear in Trieste Forest at night,{LF}so I hear...
I...do hate to ask, but...{LF}Please, get me a ＠アイテム９＠...{LF}Thank you...
I...do hate to ask, but...{LF}Please, get me a ＠アイテム９＠...{LF}Thank you...
(Right, now I just need to deliver this{LF}＠アイテム９＠)
Ah...hello...＠カイル＠＠.
Ah...well...you see...{LF}Fern is...
That doll of yours, right, Dorothy?
So, what's happened to Fern?
Fern...wants to...talk to you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
T-Talk to me...? Um, okay.{LF}Uhh...how exactly do I talk to her?
Ah...I'll tell you what she says...
So please...talk to her...
Fern is saying...h-hello...
Hello, Fern. Hello to you too,{LF}Dorothy.
Ah...Fern wants to talk to you...{LF}Or rather, ask a question...
Would you...answer her...?
Yeah, no problem.
...
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, what do you{LF}think is the principal that guides{LF}your actions?
That's her question.
So, uhh...what's the principal I live{LF}by...? (Is she testing my values...?)
To help everyone as much as I can.
To take care of myself first.
...
I see... That's a good way to live!{LF}Please stay friends with Dorothy!
That's her reply.
O-Okay.
I'm glad she approves.
Here's...a reward...
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Th-Thank you...
I'll see you again, then...
...
I see... That's a very selfish{LF}attitude. If everyone thought that{LF}way, the world would be a terrible{LF}place!
You need to rethink that, young man.
Ye-Yes. I will.{LF}(Boy, I got chewed out...by a doll...?)
...
Ah... well...goodbye then...
Ah...＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Hello.
Well...today is a beautiful day,{LF}isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Do you...want anything?
Would you...would you...{LF}p-p-please...
T-T-Tackle a w-weak with me...?
Tackle a...what...?
Ah...! That came out...all wrong...!
Oh...oh...oh...
???
Okay...okay...
Fern... Please...tell him.
...
Dorothy wants to take a walk with you.
Take...a walk?
That's right. She'll be waiting in{LF}front of the church tomorrow.
Okay... I understand.
Good. Make sure you show up tomorrow.
I'll give you back to Dorothy now.
...
That's...what I wanted to say...{LF}so, can we take a walk?
Okay. I'll look forward to it, Dorothy.
Okay...thanks...
Well...I'll be waiting in front of the{LF}church...tomorrow...
Hi, Dorothy.
!!!
H-Hello, ＠カイル＠＠...
Just wait a moment, please...
...
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's me, Fern.
Hello, Fern...
I need to talk to you about Dorothy.{LF}Please, will you listen?
Yes, of course. {LF}(What's going on...? I thought I was{LF}here to spend time with Dorothy...)
Dorothy trains hard every day to be a{LF}nurse, but, as I'm sure you're aware, {LF}she's also very shy.
Well, I think it's great that{LF}she's trying.
It's not easy for her.
She studies very hard, and she's{LF}very passionate about medicine.
But, no matter what she does, she can't{LF}seem to communicate effectively with {LF}other people.
But that's a vital part of being a {LF}nurse.
I believe that the key to solving{LF}this, the one thing keeping her from{LF}being a great nurse...
Lies with you.
With...me?
That's right. Could you help her to{LF}finally open her heart?
If it will help Dorothy, then I'll do{LF}whatever I can.
Thank you. I knew you were the right{LF}person to ask. So please...take care{LF}of Dorothy.
...
Ah...so...
Don't over-think this. Just relax  {LF}and take your time to decide.
Okay... Thank you...
I'm sorry about today...for taking up{LF}your time. Well...goodbye.
So...the only way Dorothy can express{LF}her true feelings is through her{LF}doll...
From what the doll just told me,{LF}though...
...it sounds like Dorothy really wants{LF}to get better at talking to people.
To help her, I'll need to get her{LF}to start talking without that doll.
Well, it looks like I'll have to{LF}take that walk with her sometime in{LF}the future.
Hello...＠カイル＠＠.
You see...I...want to become a nurse.
I know that. I think wanting to become{LF}a nurse is a wonderful goal.
...
There's no need to be so embarrassed!{LF}(She's turned bright red!)
(Oh no! I need to make her more{LF}comfortable.)
So working as a nurse is actually pretty {LF}tough, I guess, isn't it?
Yeah...that's right... And so...
So...there's something I'd like to ask{LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠...
Just hold on a minute...okay...?
Dorothy, stop!{LF}Let's talk without Fern, okay?
Huh...? Um, well...I'm not sure...
You want to take the nursing exam,{LF}don't you, Dorothy?
Th-That's right...and the written part{LF}is no problem, but...
But?
The interview...
Ah, the interview.{LF}I can see how that might be a problem.
That's right... So, I was hoping you{LF}might help me practice a little...
You know...to get me ready...?
Yeah. No problem, Dorothy.
Th-Thanks...
Okay! I'll be the interviewer.{LF}Let's practice.
Hello, Dorothy.
First...
Let's start with an introduction.
Let's start with your self-analysis.
Okay...my name is Dorothy...
That was easy. Let's keep going!
Okay...
Huh...? Ah...ah...
A little hard for the first question,{LF}I guess.
...
Let's just carry on.
Next...
What do you like?
What don't you like?
I like Cymbidium orchids. They{LF}are also called boat orchids, and{LF}their name comes from kumbos, {LF}meaning hole or cavity. 
Wow. You know a lot about flowers.
Ah...well... I do like flowers...
That was good. Well done.
Ah...well...
A little hard for you to answer?
...
Let's just carry on.
Well then...
Will you lend me that doll for a moment?
What's the name of your doll?
...
I'm sorry... I can't...do that.
...
Please forget that.
Fern...that's her name.
Did you choose her name, Dorothy?
Ah...yes, I did...
That's quite a rare name. And a good{LF}one, I think.
Oh...thank you...
So...
What's the best way to maintain beauty?
What's the best way to maintain health?
I...don't know...
Ah...I guess that's not really related{LF}to being a nurse.
...
Just forget that one, okay?
Wake up early...{LF}and go to bed early...
Ah, so that's the secret to good{LF}health?
That's right... Don't work too late{LF}yourself, ＠カイル＠＠...
I'll be careful not to.
Finally...
Do you have lots of friends?
Do you have a very close friend?
...
(That was a nasty question.)
...
Don't worry about that, then.
Yes...{LF}Someone called ＠カイル＠＠...
Hah hah hah. Thank you. I'm very{LF}happy to hear that.
...
(She's clammed up again. Well, she{LF}did pretty well without Fern.)
That's all for the interview. Well done!
Thank you. I think...{LF}I've found some confidence.
Great! Now you'll be able to ace the{LF}interview, too.
Well...I hope so...
If you keep on talking to people,{LF}you'll keep getting more and more{LF}confident, too!
O-Okay...
Well... I knew I could count on you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you...very much...
I'm just happy to be able to help you{LF}out, Dorothy.
(She's finally found some confidence.{LF}Great!)
My confidence...has...
Totally gone...
Oh no... Sorry, I didn't really ask{LF}good questions, did I?
...
Ah...＠カイル＠＠...{LF}you came.
You see...I've got a bit of a{LF}problem...
Recently, there have been a lot of{LF}times...when I've been looking for {LF}Cammy around town...and can't find her.
I think she's going into the forest...{LF}There are monsters in there. It's {LF}too dangerous...
But she won't listen to me when{LF}I tell her that.
I've tried, but it's no good. So...{LF}could you try talking to her,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...?
I'm her older sister, I know...{LF}so I don't like to ask...
I see... Cammy can be pretty wild,{LF}it's true.
I'll try talking to her.
Thank you so much...
Please...try to warn Cammy not to go{LF}into the forest anymore...
She won't listen to me.
I talked to Cammy like you asked,{LF}Dorothy.
Thank you!{LF}Did she listen to you, then...?
Well...I think she might have.{LF}She paid attention, at least.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}As I thought, there's a lot I can learn{LF}from you...
Let me...thank you, ＠カイル＠＠...
Here, please...take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you.
If you need me for anything else, just{LF}let me know.
Ah...hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
I've...just baked some chocolate{LF}cookies...
I...had some trouble with the oven,{LF}to start with...
And burned about...8 batches...
They may not taste all that good,{LF}but...please...
Will you eat them?
You got chocolate cookies!
(I think Dorothy has started to open up{LF}a little. She's talking a little more{LF}easily...)
(She's talking for herself now, too.{LF}That's progress.)
Thank you. Can I try one?
Ah...yes! Please, do...
Okay! Here we go!
*crunch crunch*
Wow!
These are really good!
These are awful!
These are really good, Dorothy.
Th-Thank you... I'm glad...{LF}you like them...
You've got real talent here, Dorothy.
Oh, no... I just got lucky with this{LF}batch... There's no need to say that...
I want to eat more!{LF}These really are good!
Okay...If you say so, ＠カイル＠＠...
I'll try...to make some more...
Then I'll look forward to it.
I'll...bring you them every day,{LF}then...
I think every day might be overkill.{LF}No need to go quite that far!
Okay...
Next time I see you, then.
Great! I can't wait!
Thanks...!|
I'll just have one more, then.
Hey? What're you doing with{LF}＠カイル＠＠, sis?
Ah...Cammy...!
Hey! Chocolate cookies!
I want some too!
*crunch crunch*
These are great!
Really? Thank you.
You baked them?
Yes.
They're fantastic! Give me more!
Hey...{LF}Those are for ＠カイル＠＠...
*crunch crunch*
Delicious!|
*crunch crunch*
Phew! I'm stuffed! Fantastic!
Oh...there's only one left...{LF}for ＠カイル＠＠...
Ah! I know! These are so good,{LF}I'll take one to Roy!
I'll take this, thanks!
Now I'm very busy! Got lots more{LF}playing to do! See you later!
Oh...!{LF}＠カイル＠＠'s cookies...!
They're all gone...
They were really good.{LF}I just would have liked a few more.
Yes...
Thank you.
I'll make more for you next time.
Great! I'll look forward to it.
Okay!
They...are pretty awful...
I'm sorry!
They don't taste much like chocolate...{LF}in fact...just what did you put in them {LF}to create a flavor like this...?
Ah...well...it's a secret recipe,{LF}but...
Lamp Grass, Scorpion Pinch, Tuna,{LF}Carrots, Onions, Pineapple...
Okay...you're upsetting my stomach.{LF}Please, that's enough...
Why did you put all of that stuff in it?
But...I just followed the recipe as {LF}shown in this book...
I see...that sounds like an odd recipe. {LF}Can I take a look?
Okay...
Hmmm....
Hey...!
It's pretty obvious, I think...that {LF}this has been altered by someone.
Looks like a child's writing.
I...I didn't notice...!
I can only think of one person who{LF}could have done this...!
Oh? What's up, you guys?
Wanna play hide-and-go-seek?
Hi, Cammy.{LF}You look full of energy again today!
So, can I ask you something? Are you the {LF}one who added all the extra ingredients {LF}to this recipe?
Yeah! That's right. I was bored, so I{LF}changed it to something more fun!
More fun...? I don't know about that...
Don't tell me...you made them?{LF}And ate them?
That's right.
What?! You really made them?!
I never thought anyone would...!
...
You made them, sis?
Yeah.
Wow! Tricked you good, didn't I!|
Cammy, please...
Oh, I'm sorry, sis...!|
Now I'm very busy! Got lots more{LF}playing to do! See you later!
Cammy was the culprit.
She can do some terrible things,{LF}sometimes, just because she's so {LF}naive...
Well, I guess that's just who she is.
She didn't expect anyone to really make {LF}them. She wasn't cruel on purpose.
I know...
I'll make proper cookies for you next{LF}time, then, ＠カイル＠＠...
Great! I'll look forward to it.
I'm sorry...for all of this today...
Oh, that's not a problem. Don't worry {LF}about it.
Well...thank you...
Hello...＠カイル＠＠.
I've got a problem...{LF}Fern won't talk to me...
This is the first time this has ever{LF}happened... Did I...do something {LF}wrong...? 
(Dorothy makes Fern talk.)
(I guess...if Fern really isn't{LF}talking, then Dorothy must be{LF}outgrowing Fern...)
I think, Dorothy, that it's because{LF}you've become closer to {LF}your other friends.
Do you...really think so?
Yeah, I do.
Fern has been a very close friend{LF}of yours, hasn't she Dorothy?
And she's been the only one you've{LF}opened your heart too until now, hasn't {LF}she?
That's why she's always answered you.
But now, you've found someone other than {LF}Fern who you can open up to.
So Fern is just happy that her{LF}role in your life is finished.
She may have stopped talking to you...
But I'm sure she'll always be by your{LF}side, watching over you.
You're right.
Yeah.
Fern...thank you for{LF}everything.
I'll care about you forever...
...
Just do your best so that Fern{LF}won't have to worry about you anymore.
I will...
And...
You've given me a lot of...confidence,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. Thank you.
No problem, Dorothy.
(Dorothy is really changing.)
(She's become more outgoing than {LF}before.)
(Now she can even talk without using{LF}Fern... That's real progress.)
(I don't think I need to worry about her{LF}anymore.)
Hello...＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, Dorothy.
Ah...well...you see...
Yes? What is it?
Would you...please...take me on{LF}another...date...?
I want to...go on another date with{LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠...!
Okay...
All right, let's do it, Dorothy! I'm not {LF}really sure our last date could really {LF}be called a date, anyway!
Well...then...
Th-Thank you...!
No need to thank me.
Okay...sorry...
So, what do you want to do?{LF}I'm free pretty much any time.
I-I don't think my heart can take much{LF}more of this... 
I mean...well...my heart has been{LF}beating so fast...I think I might {LF}collapse...
How about tomorrow, then?{LF}Where do you want to meet up?
Tomorrow,{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}will be good...
Okay. Then {LF}let's meet there.
Okay!{LF}Um, promise you'll come, okay?
Tomorrow,{LF}come to {LF}＠マップ９＠,{LF}okay?
Okay. I will.
I can't wait...
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠!
You really came...{LF}I'm so pleased...
You got here quite early.
Yes...{LF}I woke early and I've just been waiting.
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}You didn't have to come so early.
Oh, I couldn't help it...
I thought today we could look at the{LF}ocean and just talk.
Oh, um, okay.{LF}There are so many things I've wanted to {LF}ask you, too, ＠カイル＠＠.
Yes. It's a good chance to get {LF}to know each other better.
Oh, yes...
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, is...is there
anyone...anyone you're fond of?
Now that's a direct question!{LF}Let's see...
Mana
Dorothy
Julia
Oh...you like....Mana?{LF}Mana...she's pretty, so...
{LF}Well, um....
Well, my house does belong to Douglas,{LF}so I happen to see her a lot.{LF}That's all, I can't help noticing her.
Oh...is that it?{LF}I, I just thought...{LF}well, I thought you and Mana were...
Oh no. There's nothing between us.
Oh!{LF}Well, um...does that mean...{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
Um...oh... I'm not sure what to...
Don't worry about it, Dorothy. Just{LF}pretend I didn't say anything.
Oh... I'm sorry.{LF}It's just...
Heh.
Julia?
I...didn't realize she was your {LF}type, ＠カイル＠＠...
You two don't seem like you{LF}have much in common...
Well, she does really know how to{LF}dress...
Um...then...
I'm just kidding! You're right. She{LF}isn't quite my type.
Don't scare me like that...
Sorry.
Well, I'll ask you a question next.
Okay...
Here we go.
How are you? You seem more outgoing.
How long have you had Fern?
You don't have many friends, do you?
Now you can talk without using Fern,{LF}and I think you've really changed.
Oh...really?{LF}It makes me happy to hear you say that.
I was just too afraid of everyone and{LF}didn't even try to get to know them.
But now, I've finally realized{LF}how very nice most people are.
It's all because of you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
Thank you so much...
No, you did it yourself, Dorothy.{LF}I just gave you a little help.
You changed yourself,{LF}Dorothy.
Do you really think so?
Yes. 
I'm so happy...
You bring Fern everywhere. {LF}How long have you had that doll?
She looks like she's been {LF}around a long time.
Um, let's see... {LF}How long have I had Fern...
I've had her since I was little, so{LF}I don't know exactly, but we've been{LF}together as long as I can remember.
Oh, I see.{LF}She's important to you, isn't she?
Yes. She's very special to me...
Oh. But...I'm friends with Julia{LF}and Rosalind.{LF}
And...I think having close friends{LF}is more important than...{LF}how many friends you have...
Yes. That's one way to look at it.{LF}But that Julia is really something.{LF}The way she gets along with everyone...
I'm a little envious{LF}of Julia...{LF}I wish I could be like her...
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, if...if you were{LF}to get married...
...What kind of person do you think{LF}you'd get married to?
What kind of person...?{LF}Hmm, let's see...
Someone good at cooking.
Someone very kind.
Someone who's a good listener.
Someone good at cooking, I guess.
Good at...cooking?{LF}I do the cooking at my house, but...{LF}I'm not sure if it tastes good...
I'd love to try your cooking{LF}sometime, Dorothy.
What?!{LF}Oh, I don't know, but...
I'll cook up my best for you!
Good. I'm looking forward to it!
Oh dear. When you say that...{LF}it, it makes me...kind of nervous...
Someone very kind, I guess.
Someone very kind?{LF}I'd like...someone who is kind too...
Someone nice like you, ＠カイル＠＠...
You're a nice person, ＠カイル＠＠...
Do you think so?
I think so.{LF}Do you think I'm wrong?
Well, now I wonder...{LF}Maybe my true character {LF}is actually...
Uh, wait...you're frightening me!
I like someone who will listen to{LF}every word I say.
＠カイル＠＠, do you think you might{LF}have a bit of an ego?
Well, what's the point if someone {LF}won't listen to what I have to say?
I think your wife will have her work{LF}cut out for her...
I guess so.
So, Dorothy...
I'd really like to see your whole face.
I'd really like to see your figure...
I've never seen your face, Dorothy.{LF}Could you just give me a peek?
What?!{LF}Well, I'm not sure....
I'm kind of embarrassed...
Don't be shy.
Promise you won't laugh...?
I promise.
Okay, then. Just a peek...
Wow!
Well...{LF}What...What do you think?
You're really pretty! Wow, Dorothy,{LF}you should let everyone see your{LF}face.
But, well...I'm just too embarrassed...
I'm really amazed!
Oh, but...{LF}I'm so embarrassed...
This is our special secret, ＠カイル＠＠...
Heh. Well, okay.
Oh, I really can't do that...
Ha-ha-ha! I was only joking...
Oh, but...{LF}it didn't sound like a joke...
I'm sorry.
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, you're{LF}really just as nice as I thought{LF}you'd be...
I think...{LF}I like you even more, now,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
I find you even more charming now{LF}that I understand you, too, Dorothy.
Oh...um...{LF}Well, I look forward to{LF}more times together like this...
Me too.{LF}Today was really fun.
Yes...{LF}It was really nice...
＠カイル＠＠, can we have another{LF}date sometime?
Certainly. I'd love to.
Oh, that makes me so happy...
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, you're not as{LF}shallow as I thought you were.
I'm really glad I got to see some{LF}sides of you I never expected...
You're even more charming now...
I find you even more charming now{LF}that I understand you, too, Dorothy.
Oh...um...{LF}Well, I look forward to{LF}more times together like this...
Me too.{LF}Today was really fun.
Yes...{LF}It was really nice...
＠カイル＠＠, can we have another{LF}date sometime?
Certainly. I'd love to.
Oh, that makes me so happy...
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, you're actually{LF}a pretty unusual person,{LF}aren't you...?
I never thought you were{LF}like that at all...
But, I guess that might be what{LF}makes you so attractive...
I like you even{LF}more than before...
I find you even more charming now{LF}that I understand you, too, Dorothy.
Oh...um...I'm looking forward to{LF}more times together like this...
Me too.{LF}Today was really fun.
Yes...{LF}It was really nice...
＠カイル＠＠, can we have another{LF}date sometime?
Certainly. I'd love to.
Oh, that makes me so happy...
Oh...um... {LF}This...this is just a little something{LF}I'd like you to have...
You got: ＠アイテム９＠.
I made it for you, {LF}to protect you from harm, ＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you, Dorothy.{LF}You made this for me?
I'll cherish it always.
Today was...{LF}Thank you for today...
Well, then...{LF}See you later, ＠カイル＠＠.
Uh... It looks like you have a lot{LF}to carry. Could you lighten your load?
It looks like you're carrying a{LF}lot of stuff... Could you lighten{LF}your backpack a little?
Spring has come...
It's gotten so warm.{LF}It always makes me sleepy.{LF}Ha-ha-ha!
Oh...um...
Oh, what is it?　Dorothy?
Well...{LF}Huh? Oh!...um, yes!{LF}It really makes you.... sleepy.
(Was she just sleeping?)
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival,
so, um...my father is always, well...{LF}when he's had something to drink, he can{LF}be a little crazy, so...be careful..
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}So, Gordon can be wild at parties?{LF}Well, I'll be sure to keep my distance.
Oh, I hate earthquakes...
Dorothy, are you okay?!
Yes...{LF}I'm fine...
But, um, thanks for worrying about me...
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest...{LF}I'm really worried that Herman is going{LF}to just collapse one day...
Well, Herman is certainly{LF}in another league {LF}than the rest of us{LF}when it comes to food.
Swimming season starts tomorrow.{LF}But I...{LF}I'm really not very good at swimming...
Well, you can still at least wade{LF}in a little where it's not too deep,{LF}right?
Well, I think{LF}I can handle that...
Tomorrow is the Monster Taming Contest.
Oh, the Monster Taming Contest?{LF}Sounds like that'll be something to see!
Umm, if you enter, ＠カイル＠＠, well,{LF}please be careful, okay?
Another earthquake...{LF}Fern and I are both okay...
Oh, good! I'm glad you're okay.{LF}I hope everyone else is all right.
Umm, I'm glad to see you're{LF}okay, too, ＠カイル＠＠.
The sun is really getting hot...
It sure is.{LF}It really feels like summer, doesn't it?
Um...so, be careful not to get{LF}overheated when you work in the fields.
Okay. I'll be careful.
Oh, tomorrow is the Dance Festival...{LF}Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you plan to{LF}ask anyone...{LF}Oh, I mean...never mind!
So, tomorrow is the Fishing Contest.{LF}Are you good at fishing,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I think I'm better at eating fish{LF}than catching them.
*giggle* I'm actually pretty{LF}good at fishing...
The Adventure Contest is tomorrow...
Adventure Contest? Sounds exciting!
＠カイル＠＠, if you do enter the contest,{LF}please don't go anywhere dangerous,{LF}okay?
Well, I won't take any unnecessary{LF}risks, but if I'm going to compete,{LF}I have to give it my best shot.
There was another earthquake.{LF}Are you okay?
I'm fine.{LF}But, what about you, Dorothy?
Oh, I'm...I'm okay.{LF}It was scary, but I'm fine now.
So...tomorrow is the Harvest Festival.{LF}Well, um...so, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I want to thank you for your hard work.
Huh? Oh, don't thank me...
Oh, sorry...I can't help it...{LF}It's just that when I think of the{LF}Harvest Festival, I think of you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
So, um...it's really cooled off...
It sure has. I guess autumn is here.{LF}Everything tastes delicious in the fall,{LF}so it's really easy to overeat!
You really must keep watch {LF}over yourself.{LF}It would be really silly to eat {LF}too much and get yourself sick.
Um...{LF}well, anyway, {LF}that's what Fern always says.
Oh, tomorrow is the Monster Contest.
It's kind of strange, isn't it?{LF}A monster show?
I really, um...{LF}I really don't like this festival.
If any frightening monsters come out,{LF}I'll just run away...
Tomorrow is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Shooting stars are really beautiful, but{LF}I don't know...{LF}They're just so short lived...
It's true they only last{LF}for a moment.
But, that's what I love about them...{LF}It's part of what makes them so{LF}special.
It's really gotten cold...{LF}Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, you haven't{LF}caught a cold or anything have you?
Oh, I have the chills and a runny nose.
Are you okay?{LF}Um...if you'd like, I can give you my{LF}hand warmer...
I have lots more, so...
What!{LF}Do you always walk around with so{LF}many hand warmers, Dorothy?!
Oh, well, um...I'm cold-natured, so...
The Mining Contest is tomorrow...{LF}I'm no good at things like that...
I can't imagine you doing anything that{LF}requires that much strength, Dorothy!
Yes, well...{LF}my father is good at that kind of thing.
Dorothy, there was another earthquake.{LF}Are you okay?
Oh, I'm...I'm okay.{LF}Fern rescued me...
Fern?{LF}Well, at any rate, you're not hurt.
Come tomorrow another year will be over.{LF}For me, it was really a good year...
I'm looking forward to spending next {LF}year with you, too, Dorothy!
Huh?{LF}Oh!...um, yes!
Yes, me too...
Aren't the cherry blossoms pretty?{LF}Spring is such a lovely season...
The sun is so bright,{LF}I can't even open my eyes...
Autumn is for harvesting...{LF}I wonder if ＠アルス＠＠{LF}will have a good harvest, too...
Walk carefully on the snowy roads{LF}or you might slip and fall...
Good morning, Dorothy.
Um...
Hello, Dorothy.
Um...well, uh...
Good evening, Dorothy.
Oh, um...
so, did you need me for something?
Oh, no. Nothing like that, but...
Oh...um...well,{LF}good-bye, then...
Um...{LF}um...did you need me for something?
Oh, no. Nothing like that, but...
Oh...um...well, then...{LF}good-bye...
Umm...{LF}so...did you need me for something?
Oh, no. Nothing like that, but...
Um...well, uh...
Um...{LF}so, then.. is something wrong?
Oh, no, but...{LF}What's your favorite thing to eat,{LF}Dorothy?
Oh, um....I like...I like fish...{LF}and, um...I really{LF}like...＠アイテム９＠.
So, um....{LF}so, then.. is something wrong?
Oh, no, but...{LF}What's your favorite thing to eat,{LF}Dorothy?
Oh, um....I like...I like fish...{LF}and, um...I really{LF}like...＠アイテム９＠.
So, um...{LF}so...did you need me for something?
Oh, no, but...{LF}What's your favorite thing to eat,{LF}Dorothy?
Oh, um....I like...I like fish...{LF}and, um...I really{LF}like...＠アイテム９＠.
How are you doing, Dorothy?
Uh, I'm...I'm fine, ＠カイル＠＠.
You look like you're well too, ＠カイル＠＠.
How are you doing, Dorothy?
Oh, umm...well, I'm good.
How are you doing, Dorothy?
I...um, I'm fine...
Dorothy!
Oh!{LF}Hi there...{LF}Um, what is it, ＠カイル＠＠?
You don't have to act{LF}so surprised...
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh!{LF}Hi, hi there...{LF}what is it, ＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, it's nothing.{LF}Sorry,{LF}I didn't mean to surprise you.{LF}
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh!{LF}Hi there...{LF}Um, what is it, ＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, I'm sorry for{LF}taking you by surprise...
So, Dorothy,{LF}any good news lately?
What? Oh, um...{LF}well, I can't think of anything, sorry.
Ha-ha-ha! No need to apologize!{LF}I was just asking...
So, Dorothy,{LF}any good news lately?
Well, um...I can't think of anything{LF}right now, but, um...{LF}Oh, I'm sorry...
Ha-ha-ha! No need to apologize!{LF}I was just asking...
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}um...anything new with you?
Me?{LF}Oh, not really. Why do you ask?
Oh, um...nothing.{LF}I was just wondering...
Dorothy, what are your favorite{LF}things?
Um...I like, um, flowers, and...{LF}the flower I really like is{LF}＠アイテム８＠...
You like flowers? That's wonderful!
Oh...really?
Dorothy, is there something{LF}that you really like?
Um...I like, um, flowers, and...{LF}the flower I really like is{LF}＠アイテム８＠...
You like flowers? That's wonderful!
Oh...really?
Dorothy, is there something{LF}that you really like?
Um...I like, um, flowers, and...{LF}the flower I really like is{LF}＠アイテム８＠...
You like flowers? That's wonderful!
Oh...really?
Um...I'm not very good at talking to{LF}people, but do you enjoy talking to me?
It's very interesting.{LF}The more I talk to you, the more I{LF}see what kind of person you are.
Oh, um...thank you!
Um...I'm not very good at talking to{LF}people, but do you enjoy talking to me?

It's very interesting.{LF}The more I talk to you, the more I{LF}see what kind of person you are.
Well, um...{LF}I enjoy talking to you, too {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I don't talk to people very{LF}often, so usually Fern{LF}does the talking{LF}for me...
It seems like Fern{LF}reflects your own feelings.{LF}Do you think so, Dorothy?
Um...Fern is Fern.{LF}She's separate from me.
I don't talk to people very{LF}often, so usually Fern{LF}does the talking {LF}for me, but...
Are Fern' words really{LF}your own, Dorothy?
We're not the same, and it makes{LF}me angry {LF}if you say strange things like that.
Well....{LF}anyway, that's what Fern says.
I don't talk to people very often, so{LF}Fern talks quite a bit, but...
Are Fern's words really{LF}your own, Dorothy?{LF}Sometimes she can sound pretty harsh...
We're not the same, and it makes{LF}me angry{LF}if you say strange things like that.
Well...{LF}anyway, that's what Fern says.
I don't like{LF}＠アイテム７＠...
Cammy always brings me them, though.{LF}She's very strange...
I don't like{LF}＠アイテム７＠...

Um...so, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}What...um, how do you feel.. about me?
Why do you ask?
Oh, it's not important.
Oh, nothing!{LF}It's really nothing.{LF}Never mind!
Umm, so...{LF}Oh, I see...
Um...so, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}What...um, how do you feel.. about me?
Why do you ask?
Oh, it's not important.
Really, it's nothing...{LF}Forget what I just said!
So....{LF}Um...I see...{LF}It's not important...
Um...so, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}What...um, how do you feel..about me?
Uh...well, um...
Oh, it's not important.
I love you.
Oh, never mind. Pretend I never{LF}asked!
Um...I see...{LF}Oh, it's not important...
What!{LF}I..you...{LF}You shouldn't{LF}say such silly things...
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you're really working hard at your farm.
Well, yeah, I guess so...
Well, um...you always give me{LF}such delicious vegetables.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}well, um, I appreciate your hard work...
Huh? Well, thanks. Ha-ha!
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, your{LF}produce is always{LF}um, very delicious.
I, well, I really, really like it...
＠カイル＠＠,  it must be hard{LF}working so late in the fields...
Oh, not really. It's my job, after all.{LF}Ha-ha!
Well, um...take good care{LF}of yourself, okay?
Certainly. Thank you, Dorothy.
Dorothy, you always have{LF}your eyes hidden behind your bangs.{LF}Can you see where you're going?
Oh, well, actually...um...{LF}sometimes I can't see so well, but...
That's dangerous!{LF}You don't want to have an accident!{LF}You'd better uncover your eyes!
But, well...I'm just too shy...
Dorothy, you always have{LF}your eyes hidden behind your bangs.{LF}Can you see where you're going?
Oh, I can see...I can see just fine.
But...those people just behind you{LF}do look a little fuzzy, so... {LF}they're a little bit hard to see, ＠カイル＠＠{LF}but, um...
What? I think you may be seeing things{LF}the rest of us can't...
Dorothy, you always carry your doll,{LF}Fern, with you.{LF}Do you ever go anywhere without her?
Um, well...{LF}No, I always have her with me.{LF}I even take my bath with her...
Really? That's...uh, interesting...
I don't like the dark, so...{LF}I can't sleep at night{LF}without the lights on.
I don't like the dark, so...{LF}I can't sleep at night{LF}without the lights on.
I don't like the dark, so...{LF}I can't sleep at night{LF}without the lights on.
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}dreams for your future?
Well, I haven't really decided.{LF}Right now, I'm happy with farming, but{LF}I don't know about the future...
Well, ＠カイル＠＠, you seem like{LF}a person who can do just{LF}about anything...
I really admire you...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}dreams for your future?
Well, I haven't really decided.{LF}Right now, I'm happy with farming, but{LF}I don't know about the future...
I...um, I really want to become a nurse.
When I was a child, I had a high fever,{LF}and the nurse who cared for me was{LF}so talented and, I just....{LF}well, I really admired her...
That's an excellent goal!{LF}You're so kind, Dorothy.{LF}I think you'd make an excellent nurse!
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you have any{LF}dreams for your future?
Well, I haven't really decided.{LF}Right now, I'm happy with farming, but{LF}I don't know about the future...
Oh, I always assumed that{LF}you would just be a farmer...
So, ＠カイル＠＠, um...{LF}what do you think of Fern?
I think she's cute, but...
Oh, I don't know.
*giggle*{LF}Did you hear that? ＠カイル＠＠ says{LF}you're cute, Fern!
Oh, I see.{LF}Don't let it bother you, if he{LF}hasn't noticed you.
Well....{LF}Fern is angry...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}of Fern?
I think she's cute, but...
Oh, I don't know.
*giggle* Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Um...you're a really handsome man.
Um...{LF}Fern is so happy...
Oh, I see.{LF}If you two don't get along, then{LF}I guess we're done here. Bye-bye.
Well...{LF}It looks like you've{LF}made Fern angry...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I was just wondering...{LF}What do you think{LF}of Fern?
I think she's cute, but...
Oh, I don't know.
She's a little bit...well...creepy.
Did you hear that? He likes you...{LF}*giggle* You're quite nice, too.{LF}Here's to our friendship!
So...{LF}That made Fern happy...
Oh, I see.{LF}If you two don't get along, then{LF}I guess we're done here. Bye-bye.
Umm...{LF}It looks like you've{LF}made Fern angry...
Well!　How dare you say that!{LF}I can't believe you!{LF}I think someone like you with no{LF}memory is a 100 times creepier!
So...{LF}Fern is really mad!
If Fern sees me with another doll,{LF}she gets really jealous...
Fern really loves you,{LF}doesn't she, Dorothy.
So, I really can't talk{LF}to other dolls...
You have a lot to worry about...
If Fern sees me with other dolls,{LF}she gets really jealous...
I've never seen you carrying{LF}any doll other than Fern,{LF}Dorothy.
Fern would get angry...{LF}But, it's okay because{LF}I love Fern, too.
If Fern sees me with{LF}another doll,{LF}she gets really jealous...
I've never seen you carrying{LF}any doll other than Fern,{LF}Dorothy.
I guess I'm happiest when{LF}I'm with Fern, too...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}Do you ever think about{LF}um...about marriage?
Not yet.
Sometimes I do.
Oh... Really...?
Oh...um...well...{LF}Do you...um, do you {LF}have someone in mind?{LF}Oh...uh, never mind...
You should have seen{LF}my father after the wedding...{LF}He got so drunk at the reception, {LF}and it was just a mess...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}do you ever think about{LF}um...about marriage?
Not yet.
I do.
Oh...you do...
Well...{LF}I sometimes think I'd like{LF}to get married soon, too.
Marriage must be, um...{LF}must be really nice.
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}lately, do you ever think about{LF}um...about marriage?
Not yet.
I do.
Oh...you do...{LF}Oh, never mind...
Oh, really?{LF}I sometimes think I'd like to...{LF}oh, nothing...
That wedding dress....{LF}it was so beautiful....
I think I'm comfortable talking{LF}to you, ＠カイル＠＠, but{LF}I'm not so good at, um...{LF}talking to other people, yet.
I get so embarrassed if they look at me.
Maybe you should try{LF}thinking about the times when{LF}you've talked with me.
Okay, maybe....{LF}If I think about talking with{LF}you, then...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you ever get{LF}embarrassed when, um...{LF}when people look at you in the eyes?
Well, no.{LF}It doesn't really bother me.
I really don't like it{LF}when people look in my eyes...
Umm,  ＠カイル＠＠, do you ever get{LF}embarrassed when, um...{LF}when people look at you in the eyes?
I really don't like it{LF}when people look in my eyes...
Well, no.{LF}It doesn't really bother me.
My father always tells me{LF}to look people in the eyes{LF}when I speak, but...
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about the{LF}Forest of Beginnings?
What's that?
Yes, I do.
I hear it's...um...{LF}a forest where monsters live...
I wonder what sort of life monsters{LF}live...
Oh, you already know about it...
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about the{LF}Forest of Beginnings?
What's that?
Yes, I do.
When you defeat a monster, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I hear that they are sent there.{LF}They don't really die.
Oh, you already know about it?
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about the{LF}Forest of Beginnings?
What's that?
Yes, I do.
They say it's where all{LF}the monsters live.
I wonder if the cute monsters{LF}get along with the{LF}scary ones.
Oh, if you know about it, then{LF}never mind...
＠カイル＠＠, is there, um...{LF}anything about this village that{LF}you don't like?
Well, not anything I can think of.{LF}What about you, Dorothy?
Oh, um... {LF}Oh, no...I didn't{LF}mean it like that.
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠, is there anything{LF}um...anything about this village that{LF}you don't like?
Well....{LF}I can't think of anything, really.{LF}What about you, Dorothy?
Oh, not really.{LF}I don't, but I just wondered if...{LF}um, if there's anything you don't like.
＠カイル＠＠,  is there anything, um...{LF}anything you don't like{LF}about this village?
No, not really.
I guess I'd like to have bigger fields.
Oh, really? Well...{LF}I like this village, too...
*giggle* ＠カイル＠＠, you're really{LF}dedicated to your work...
＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}you really work closely with nature.
It must be very difficult...{LF}I don't think I could do it...
Ha-ha-ha! It's quite easy to get used {LF}to, but I was totally lost when I {LF}started.
Oh, really? Well...{LF}That's hard to imagine when I{LF}look at you now, ＠カイル＠＠.
＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}your lifestyle is really{LF}close to nature.{LF}It must be very difficult...
I don't think I could ever do it...
Ha-ha! It certainly can be difficult,{LF}but I still think it's really{LF}interesting to see the crops growing.
Oh, I see...{LF}I'm amazed by how well you get along{LF}with nature.
＠カイル＠＠, so...{LF}your lifestyle is{LF}really close to nature.{LF}It must be very difficult...
I don't think I could ever do it...
Ha-ha-ha{LF}It certainly can be difficult, but{LF}when I see the crops growing,{LF}it makes me glad I've kept at it.
Oh, I see...{LF}It looks like you've really settled in{LF}as a farmer, ＠カイル＠＠.
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragon?
It's a dragon found in legends.{LF}When I heard about it in storybooks when{LF}I was little, it was so scary!{LF}I had to cover my ears!
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragon?
It's a legendary dragon that has{LF}frightening powers...
When I heard about it in storybooks when{LF}I was little, I remember being so scared{LF}that I couldn't sleep at night...
＠カイル＠＠, do you know about{LF}the Elder Dragon?
It's a legendary dragon that has{LF}frightening powers...
If something like that ever attacks, {LF}would you...please protect me?
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes, what is it?
Well, um...{LF}thank you for talking to me...
Ever since I met you, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}well... I feel like, um...{LF}I've changed a little bit.
Oh, I'm really thankful that I met{LF}you, too, Dorothy.{LF}Remember how you used to run away{LF}when we first met?

Ha ha ha!{LF}That was kind of alarming!
Oh, um...I'm sorry.{LF}But I don't run away anymore, right?
I'm really happy we're friends,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.

The warm weather feels good, doesn't it?{LF}It always makes me sleepy.
Be careful not to get over heated{LF}when you play outside.
I hope Cammy isn't being{LF}a nuisance.{LF}That child is such a trouble maker.
It's looks cold out.{LF}I hate being cold, so I don't{LF}go out much this time of year.
Oh, are you going for a walk?
You always have so much energy.
Isn't the foliage pretty?{LF}It's mesmerizing...
If I walk too much, I could{LF}slip and get hurt.
Have you been checking the bulletin {LF}board? Listen to everyone's advice, {LF}okay?
The fountain is a welcome{LF}relief from this heat.{LF}It must feel good.
This place is always so busy.
The plaza seems so peaceful{LF}when it's covered with snow...
The cherry blossoms are falling{LF}and look so beautiful.
It makes me hot just standing up.
The fall colors are so pretty right now.
Be careful. That Cammy is likely to{LF}throw a snowball at you anytime.
Um...the breeze feels nice doesn't it?
It's, um...so relaxing...
What a cool breeze.
It's a little chilly here.
Oh, you look happy.
Oh, you look happy.

Be sure to wash off all that sweat.
I always end up taking a long bath...

Oh, are you looking for Cammy?
Going to the church for something?
Is everything okay? What are {LF}you going to the church for?
Oh, thank you for being so kind to{LF}Cammy all the time.

If you get tired, come home and rest, {LF}okay?
Don't go anywhere{LF}too dangerous, okay?
It's cold out.{LF}It's fine to play outside, but{LF}be careful not to catch a cold.
Go to sleep when you get tired.
It's fine to play outside, but{LF}you have to get your homework done.
＠アルス＠＠'s crops{LF}taste so delicious.
Don't stray too far from the house,{LF}okay?
＠アルス＠＠, now don't wander{LF}too far from the village, okay?{LF}Be sure to tell Cammy, too...
Are you doing anything dangerous?
Don't do anything dangerous, okay?

Wow, you really look handsome.{LF}Somehow, you look so mature...
Your father is back, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I'm so happy!
＠カイル＠＠,  I'm so glad{LF}you're back...
Oh, I'm surprised to meet you here...
How have you been, ＠アルス＠＠?

＠カイル＠＠, are you getting in the hot tub?
Don't get in until you wash off good!{LF}Do you understand?
It's such a nice, big tub, so{LF}be quiet and don't spoil it.
But actually{LF}it is more fun to splash and play.
I can't wait to get out and have milk.{LF}I think milk just tastes delicious{LF}right after a good bath.
My house is really big, isn't it?{LF}There's lots of room to play!
Since I live at the church,{LF}it's really interesting{LF}when everyone comes.
Be careful, there are lots of things{LF}at my house that are breakable...
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, did you{LF}come to listen to my father talk?{LF}Or would you rather play with me?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠! Wanna play{LF}hide and seek?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, while you're here,{LF}want to play tag?
OK! You're it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I'll run away!
On the other hand...
My bed is so soft and fluffy.{LF}I really proud of it.
Hey, who are you? I've never seen{LF}you before!
Hey there! My name is ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What's your name?
I'm Cammy! So, where are you{LF}from?
Well, I'm not really sure{LF}myself...

Heh, yeah, it is kinda weird, huh?
Well, whatever! I'll forgive{LF}you, cuz you're handsome!

I don't see what it has to do with{LF}becoming a man...
That was amazing,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
No good, huh?{LF}You still have a ways to go, ＠カイル＠＠.

Sure, that's what Alvarna is famous for!{LF}Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, you should{LF}enter the contest too!
Wow, ＠カイル＠＠, you're amazing!{LF}Maybe you should become a fisherman{LF}instead of a farmer!{LF}What do you think?
Oh, that wasn't so good.{LF}Maybe I should teach you how to fish!
The Big Cook-Off is today!{LF}＠アルス＠＠, are you any good{LF}at cooking?

Really?{LF}But, they're really cool!
＠カイル＠＠, you were amazing!
Oh, that was no good!{LF}My fault - I should have shown you{LF}how to do it.
Today is the Monster Contest!{LF}I hope some really cool monsters show up!
＠アルス＠＠, you looked really cool!{LF}I wish I had a monster!
Oh, that was no good.{LF}Well, don't get discouraged!
Today is the Shooting Star Festival!{LF}I wonder how many shooting stars {LF}we'll see? I'm going to count them all!
Oh, today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I can't wait for tonight!|
Let's watch the stars together!
I wonder if I can stay awake that long?
Do you want to watch with me?{LF}Okay!|{LF}Then, we'll watch together!{LF}*giggle*!|
So, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}come to{LF}＠マップ９＠ at{LF}9 o'clock tonight!

I'll get sleepy.

See, right now, I'm really{LF}obsessed with collecting{LF}＠アイテム９＠.

No problem! So, what do you need?
No problem! So, what do you need?
Well... I've heard there's an{LF}enormous tree in Trieste Forest!
And I really want to see this{LF}gigantic tree for myself!
But if I ask a grownup, of course{LF}they'll say I can't go.
So, I know you've fought some{LF}monsters, right?
You're probably really used to the{LF}forest, I thought you might say{LF}okay...!
What? You want to go into{LF}Trieste Forest? That's still{LF}pretty dangerous...
What? You want to go into{LF}Trieste Forest? That's still{LF}pretty dangerous...
Dangerous? Hmph! Don't underestimate{LF}me, ＠アルス＠＠! Remember, I'm older{LF}than you, so I'll be fine!
You really think so? Even I'm afraid{LF}of that place sometimes...
You really think so? Even I'm afraid{LF}of that place sometimes...
There's nothing to worry about!{LF}Besides, even if it gets dangerous,{LF}you can be my white knight and{LF}protect me, right?

Oh well... Never mind! I hope we{LF}continue to stay good friends...
What is it, ＠カイル＠＠?
Cammy, have you seen anything{LF}unusual? I'm patrolling the{LF}village right now.
Anything unusual?　Not a thing!{LF}But that sounds like an{LF}interesting thing to do!
Oh!　What is it, ＠カイル＠＠?
Cammy, I hear you've been going into{LF}the forest.
How did you know that?{LF}I go there sometimes...for adventures!
There are monsters there, and{LF}it's dangerous. You should stay away{LF}from there. Dorothy's been worried.
She has?　But I'll be fine...{LF}I'm a good runner, so I can run{LF}away from any monsters!
Even if you're a fast runner, it's{LF}still dangerous. If a monster snuck {LF}up on you, or you twisted your {LF}ankle...
Okay, okay.{LF}I understand. I'll try not to go to {LF}the forest alone anymore, okay?
Okay, good.
When I feel like going, I'll ask{LF}you to go with me, okay, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well...{LF}I'd like for you to stay away from{LF}the forest altogether, but...
If anything happens, you'll rescue me,{LF}won't you, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'll do my best, but it'd be a lot{LF}better if you tried to stay out of{LF}danger in the first place!
Okay, I understand.
(Good, it looks like I've gotten{LF}through to her.)
So try not to play near the forest.
Okay. Bye bye!

Hey, Cammy. Is there something up?
Well, I've been doing some thinking...
It's about you, ＠カイル＠＠. You{LF}look like a cool guy, but really, {LF}you're not all that capable.
So I decided something!
I'm gonna give you some special{LF}training. If you follow my course,{LF}you'll never lose to anyone ever{LF}again. It'll be a total transformation!
I call it my{LF}"Super-＠カイル＠＠ Training Plan"

So, I know it's kind of sudden but{LF}today we'll be...

You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks, Cammy!

But remember, you've still{LF}got a lot of work left to do!{LF}See ya later!|
Well, that was no good...{LF}You gotta take this seriously!
Ugh, I'm tired.{LF}I think I did take it pretty seriously,{LF}but...
You're a lot less tough than I thought{LF}you were, ＠カイル＠＠. The road to{LF}becoming Super-＠カイル＠＠ is gonna{LF}be tough.

Wow, ＠カイル＠＠, you're not{LF}so lucky, are you...?
Looks like I didn't do so great{LF}today...
Well, some days you're luck, and{LF}some days you're not, I guess!

Your wife's got her work cut out{LF}for her!
What makes you say that, Cammy?

Come with me, ＠アルス＠＠!
I made this secret passageway here!
Wow, that's cool!
Wow, that's cool!
Okay, let's go!
I want to talk.
I want to take a bath.
I'm fine.
Come again!
＠アルス＠＠, did you come to{LF}take a bath too?
I'm watching the store! I'm the{LF}older one, remember?
Are you getting in the bath, ＠アルス＠＠?
Make sure to wash off before you{LF}get in. You know that, right?
The baths are nice and{LF}big here, but you still have{LF}to make sure to get in quietly.
Even though it would be much{LF}more fun to jump in.
After the bath, try drinking{LF}some milk! It's so good!
I took that candle earlier.{LF}My dad got so mad at me!{LF}Hee-hee!|
Your dad got married here too!{LF}When I get married, I think I might{LF}have my wedding here...
The stained glass windows here are{LF}really sparkly and pretty. I like them{LF}a lot.
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠, did you come to{LF}listen to my dad's sermon too? Well,{LF}you should just play with me!
We had to share it before, but{LF}now that my sister isn't in my room{LF}anymore it feels so big! 
If there's something you don't{LF}understand about cooking, how{LF}about I teach you? 'Cause I'm{LF}really good!
You have to make sure to review{LF}your lessons when you get home,{LF}no? Well, I'm always making up the{LF}recipes I learn!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠! I picked up this{LF}really pretty rock! You wanna see{LF}it?
When it's this hot out, you get{LF}so tired before you can even{LF}notice it...
Ah, I know what you mean.
Ah, I know what you mean.
But if you slack off and fall{LF}asleep, you'll get yelled at{LF}like Roy.
I really like cooking class.{LF}What about you, ＠アルス＠＠?
I like shop class.
I like cooking class.
I don't like studying.
I like shop class.
I like shop class.
Really...? Shop class is kind{LF}of hard though, isn't it?
I like cooking class too.
I like cooking class too.
Tee-hee!|{LF}Same as me!
I just don't like school.
I just don't like school.
Ah, that's so selfish of you!{LF}You've gotta stop thinking like{LF}that, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hmm, what should we do after we're{LF}done studying...
I'm always excited to {LF}see everyone at school.
There's no school tomorrow!{LF}Maybe we can play or something...
Let's give school all we've{LF}got today, ＠アルス＠＠!
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
I'm really good at cooking class.
What about the other classes?
What about the other classes?
Teeheehee....
If there's anything you don't{LF}know, I'll teach it to you!
I like school because you get{LF}to see everyone.
Boy it's hot out, isn't it?{LF}Maybe we can go swimming{LF}instead of going to class...
In the fall it gets nice and cool{LF}and classes just move right ahead!
Did you try making the {LF}recipe we learned? I did!
Professor Mana is so good at{LF}cooking... I'm so jealous.
Shop class always give me some{LF}trouble... I can never remember{LF}anything.
By the way, ＠アルス＠＠, have{LF}you been finding school helpful?
Today's lesson is about how{LF}to build a snowman!!!
Well, at least in my dreams it is.
If we had a class about snowball{LF}fights, I'm pretty sure I'd definitely{LF}be an honor student but oh well...
The trip to school is always more{LF}fun in the winter!
It's cold, so I hope she teaches{LF}us how to make some hot food!
Orland spends all of his time{LF}studying, doesn't he? It'd be{LF}good for him to let loose every{LF}once in a while.
I wonder why your dad built{LF}this school, ＠アルス＠＠.
I really like cooking class. What{LF}about you, ＠アルス＠＠?
So, what should we do after class?
I'm so good at cooking class!
I'm always excited to see{LF}everyone at school.

I'm so good at cooking class!
I'm always excited to see{LF}everyone at school.
You go into the forest to fight{LF}monsters a lot, don't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You've defeated the monsters on{LF}Blessia Island? Wow, you're so strong!
I'm afraid of really big monsters so{LF}I always just run away. But you're{LF}so brave, ＠アルス＠＠!
You've defeated monsters in the{LF}Padova Mountains? Wow, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}seems like there's nothing you can't do.
You're amazing, ＠アルス＠＠. I totally{LF}changed the way I see you, teehee.
＠カイル＠＠'s back! Isn't that great, ＠アルス＠＠?
So, what should we do?
So, what should we do?
You want to get in the bath?{LF}It costs 100G, is that okay?
Pay 100G.
Actually, I'm fine.
We're still getting ready here!
Got it! Okay, have fun in the bath!|
You're not getting in? Well, if you{LF}decide you want to later, stop by!
You already took a bath today,{LF}didn't you? You can only take one{LF}per day!
Looks like you're a little short on{LF}money. Oh well.
Don't mix up the boys' and girls' baths!
Are you giving this to me?{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
You went and got this for me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You're a life saver. You're{LF}always so helpful, ＠カイル＠＠.
Honestly, I wish Jake would learn{LF}something from you.
This isn't much, but I want you{LF}to have it. For your troubles.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you so much.{LF}Okay, I'll see you later.
Is this for me?{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Is this for me?{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
You found it. You're amazing, ＠カイル＠＠.
Okay, I'll pass it along to my customer.{LF}I'm sure he'll be really happy.
It's really good that you found it.{LF}Thank you so much, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}
Here's a little something to show{LF}my appreciation. Please, I want you{LF}to have it.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
It was no problem!
I'll make sure to mention you when{LF}I send the ring, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hey, thanks!{LF}Okay, well, I'm going to get going.
Is this for me? Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Is this for me? I'm so happy!
You can use ＠アイテム９＠ in{LF}a lot of different foods. I really{LF}treasure it.
Is this for me? Thanks so much.{LF}I'm so happy.
Oh, a ＠アイテム７＠? This{LF}is actually kind of not what{LF}I was looking for..
I actually kind of dislike this stuff...{LF}I'm really happy that you thought{LF}of me but...
Is this for me? I'm so happy!

Egan, please try this.
Is this for me?
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠, you're always such{LF}a big help. Thank you so much.
This is for you.
This is for you.
Is this for me?
Be nice to Orland, okay, ＠アルス＠＠?
This looks really good. It's{LF}definitely the kind of thing{LF}I'd want to eat on my birthday.

Ah, it's a ＠アイテム９＠. It looks{LF}really delicious. Thanks for the {LF}birthday present. It was just want {LF}I wanted.
Ah, it's a ＠アイテム９＠. It looks{LF}really delicious. Thanks for the {LF}birthday present. It was just want {LF}I wanted.
I'm really happy that you're thinking{LF}of me, but I've already gotten {LF}something...
I'd happy that you thought of me{LF}but I already got something.{LF}Thanks.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? {LF}Thanks so much, ＠カイル＠＠.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me?{LF}Thanks.
Welcome, ＠カイル＠＠.
Welcome, ＠カイル＠＠. Would{LF}you like to stay here?
No no, I've got my own house.
Haha, that's right, isn't it...?
Welcome, ＠カイル＠＠.
It's cold outside, isn't it?{LF}Please, relax and enjoy{LF}yourself.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. Welcome.
Hi, are there any rooms{LF}open today?
Huh? Um, yes, we have rooms{LF}available, but...
Okay, then I'd like to stay tonight.{LF}How much will it be?
It's 100G, but...＠カイル＠＠,{LF}don't you have your own house?
Yeah, well, Cecilia asked{LF}me to do her a favor.
Ah, that makes sense. That{LF}sounds like something she{LF}would do.
You're always taking such good{LF}care of her, so she said she wanted{LF}to help try and get you some business,{LF}even if it's just for a night.
Taking care of her... Really, she{LF}came all the way from Kardia to{LF}stay here and help me out. If{LF}anyone's being taken care of, it's me.
My son Jake might not show{LF}it, but deep down he's really{LF}happy that Ceci's here too.
My old friend Tabatha lives in{LF}Kardia. She's the one who{LF}recommended this place to{LF}Ceci.
Ah, really?
She's a really special girl.
She is, isn't she?{LF}So, can I stay here tonight?
Sure. I would hate to refuse such{LF}a kind gesture.{LF}It'll be 100G.
Ahhh, I feel so refreshed...{LF}Okay, time to get{LF}to work again.
Ah, isn't it the best to just{LF}lie around in your own house?
Seems like this hot weather{LF}never going to end.
Ah, the weather's {LF}become so perfect.{LF}Are you going on a trip {LF}or anything, ＠カイル＠＠?
Boy, it's gotten cold. Even my{LF}customers are worried that{LF}this weather won't end.
Are you taking a bath too, ＠カイル＠＠?
The bath feels the absolute{LF}best in the summer time.
If you step into the warm{LF}water, all the troubles of{LF}your day just melt away.
The bath is the best especially{LF}in the cold weather.
Pleased to meet you.{LF}You're a traveler, I assume.{LF}My name is Egan.
Nice to meet you. My name's{LF}＠カイル＠＠. How did you know that{LF}I was a traveler?
Ahh, well, I smell the wind of{LF}a different land on you. It's{LF}the Sylphs, whispering to me.
The Sylphs?
The spirits of the wind. {LF}They cannot be seen by humans.
You're not a human?
That's right. I am an elf.
Oh, really?
Indeed. This is a nice town. The{LF}spirits of the land are strong.
I see...
Well, I hope you enjoy your{LF}time here, ＠カイル＠＠. It was{LF}very nice meeting you.
Very nice meeting you, too.

Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}Are you inviting anybody?
Today's the Fishing Contest.{LF}I think I might be better at{LF}preparing fish, though...
Congratulations, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're quite the fisherman!
Ah well. You didn't win this time,{LF}but there's always next time.
Today's the Big Cook-Off.{LF}I must say, I'm quite the cook too.
It looks like you've got a real{LF}aptitude for cooking, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh well, so you didn't get{LF}it this time.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}You look like you'll be able to{LF}hold your own, ＠カイル＠＠.
Congratulations! You did it, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh well, so you didn't get it this time.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}I feel like it might still be a little too{LF}dangerous for you though, ＠アルス＠＠.
Congratulations. Looks like I{LF}underestimated you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh well. Don't let it get{LF}you too down.
Today's the Harvest Festival.{LF}We have to always make sure{LF}to be grateful for the gifts of{LF}the land.

Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}Are you going to participate, ＠カイル＠＠?
That turned out really well for{LF}you, didn't it, ＠カイル＠＠. I{LF}was very surprised.
I figured surely you'd take{LF}first place, ＠カイル＠＠, but{LF}oh well...
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}Maybe working in the caves is{LF}a little bit too dangerous.
You did it, ＠アルス＠＠. You{LF}may be small, but you're sure{LF}impressive!
What a shame. Maybe it's{LF}still a little bit too tough for you.
The year ends today.{LF}May next year be filled {LF}with happiness as well, ＠カイル＠＠.
The year ends today.{LF}I hope next year turns{LF}out just as well for you, ＠アルス＠＠.
I saw your message on the{LF}board, Egan.
I saw your message on the{LF}board, Egan.
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠. Sorry to{LF}bother you like this.
If it isn't too much trouble,{LF}could you please deliver this{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Byron for me?
I want to make sure he gets{LF}it while it's still warm.
However, I'm a bit in the{LF}middle of something right{LF}now. Would you help me out?
No problem! I'll bring it to{LF}him for you!
No problem! I'll bring it to{LF}him for you!
Thank you very much.
All right, here you go.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks so much, ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, it looks like your backpack{LF}is full... Talk to me again when{LF}you have some free space in your{LF}backpack.
Please deliver the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Byron for me.
I want to make sure he gets{LF}it while it's still warm.
Thanks for your help.
Ah, so you gave him the food{LF}for me? Thanks for helping me{LF}out.
Heh, the mayor was pretty happy!
Hee-hee, the mayor was pretty{LF}happy!
Ah, that's good to hear.{LF}Thanks again for your help.
Here, please take this. It's{LF}the least I can do to repay you.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I hope you enjoy it.
If I've got something else I{LF}need your help with, I'll be{LF}sure to let you know, ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠, I have a small{LF}favor to ask of you.
Would you mind delivering this{LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Gordon for me?
I want to make sure he gets{LF}it while it's still warm, but I'm{LF}a bit busy at the moment.
Can you can help me out?
Sure! I'll bring it to him for you!
Sure! I'll bring it to him for you!
Thank you very much.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Sorry to bother you again,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, it looks like your backpack{LF}is full... Talk to me again when{LF}you have some free space in your{LF}backpack.
Please give the ＠アイテム９＠ to{LF}Gordon for me. I want to make sure{LF}he gets it while it's still warm.
Thanks for your help delivering that{LF}for me, ＠アルス＠＠.
No problem! Gordon told me to thank{LF}you.
No problem! Gordon told me to thank{LF}you.
Ah, he did, did he? Well, it's{LF}entirely thanks to you, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Please, take this. Think of it{LF}as a reward for your hard work.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks as always for you help,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
It looks like I'll be able to make{LF}something good.
Thanks so much. You're a lifesaver.
Sorry for the trouble, and thank you{LF}so much. You're a lifesaver.
Sorry for always bothering you,{LF}but If I don't get things to customers{LF}on time, well...
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.
Egan, I saw your message{LF}on the board.
Ah, I'm so sorry to bother{LF}you ＠カイル＠＠, but I was hoping{LF}you could do me a favor.
I tried thinking up some new{LF}recipes to make for my{LF}customers, and I need{LF}someone to try them out for me.
Ah, I got it. That's no problem.
Thank you so much.
This is a new fish dish I made.{LF}Please, try it.
Okay, it looks really good.
*munch munch*
How is it?
Hmm, well, it could use a{LF}little more flavor...
Ah, really? Well, looks like{LF}it's back to the drawing{LF}board with this one.
Maybe you should try using{LF}some more spices and seasonings?{LF}Like...
Try adding more salt.
Try making it really spicy.
It tastes like maybe it could{LF}use a little more salt.
I see. I'll keep that in mind.
Maybe it could use a little kick.{LF}How about adding some{LF}more chili powder?{LF} 
Try and give it a kick?{LF}I don't mean to offend you, but{LF}that doesn't really seem like it would{LF}solve the problem here...
Hmm, I guess so. It does kind{LF}of feel like you'd just be masking{LF}the problem by making it spicy...{LF}Sorry for suggesting it.
Is there anything else you noticed?
Yes, well, I was thinking that{LF}maybe you could bring out the{LF}taste with something a little more{LF}subtle...
Try adding a little wine.
Try adding a lot of vinegar.
How about using a little wine?{LF}I hear that really brings out the{LF}flavors in cooking.
Hmm, that might be a good idea.{LF}I'll certainly try it out.
How about you try dousing{LF}it in vinegar?
Dousing it in vinegar? What{LF}good will that do?
How can I be subtle if I'm{LF}using a lot of something?
Hmm... Yeah, you're right.{LF}Sorry, I just really like vinegar.
No need to apologize.
Okay.
It looks like thanks to you{LF}I'll be able to make something{LF}good, ＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you so much.
It's really nothing. I hope{LF}it turns out well.
Well, I need to make sure{LF}it's good, considering I'll{LF}be giving it to my customers.
Here's something for your troubles.
You got the ＠アイテム８＠.
You can use these to shave{LF}the wool off of monsters{LF}you've tamed.
Thank you. Well, I'm{LF}going to be on my way.
It looks like I'll be able to make{LF}some good food, and it's all{LF}thanks to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you so much.
No no, I'm sorry that I couldn't{LF}be of any more help.
Don't worry about it, you were{LF}a great reference. Now I just{LF}have to try some things out.
Here's something for your trouble.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You can use that to shave{LF}the wool off of monsters.
Thank you. Well, I'm{LF}going to be on my way.
I'm sorry...I really wasn't{LF}any help.
No no, you gave me some{LF}really good hints about what{LF}direction I should take.
Really? Well, I'm happy you{LF}think so, but...
Now I just have to do{LF}some trial and error.
Good luck.
Thank you. I'm giving this{LF}to my customers, so I need{LF}to make sure it's good.
Here's something for your trouble.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You can use that to shave{LF}the wool off of monsters.
Thank you. Well, I'm{LF}going to be on my way.
Ah, your backpack is practically {LF}overflowing. Can you take {LF}something out for me?
Here's something for your trouble.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You can use that to shave{LF}the wool off of monsters.
Thank you. Well, I'm{LF}going to be on my way.
Hello, Egan. I saw your{LF}message on the board...
Ah, thanks for showing up.{LF}I need a favor from you. It{LF}looks like I'm nearly out of{LF}some important ingredients...
I was hoping you could go tell Cecilia{LF}to bring me some ＠アイテム９＠s when{LF}she has the chance.
Got it. So just go tell{LF}Cecilia, right?
That's it. Thanks so much.
Please tell Cecilia to bring me{LF}some ＠アイテム９＠s.
Thanks.
I gave Cecilia the message.
Oh you did? Thanks so much.{LF}You're a lifesaver.
Please, take this. For your troubles.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you.
No no, thank you.
I saw the bulletin board. What{LF}is it you need me to do?
Thanks for coming, and sorry{LF}for always bothering you.{LF}
If it's not too much trouble, could{LF}you get me an ＠アイテム９＠?
The ＠アイテム９＠ grows in Trieste{LF}Forest. I'd ask Cecilia, but I{LF}think it might be a little too{LF}dangerous for her.
And Jake would probably just{LF}tell me to get lost.
So could you please go and{LF}get one for me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah. No problem. I'll get it for you.
Thank you so much.
I need you to please get me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ from the Trieste Forest.
Sorry for always bothering you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I saw your message on{LF}the board, Egan.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. Sorry for{LF}always being such a bother.
One of my customers dropped{LF}his ＠アイテム９＠ the other day.
It's really important to him and{LF}he looked really nervous without it.
He never did find it...
So I was hoping that maybe{LF}you could look for it for me?
The customer already went{LF}back home to the city, but
when I remember how upset{LF}he looked... Well, it's starting{LF}to bother me, too.
If you find it, I was thinking{LF}I'd like to send it back to him.
Ahh, I see. No problem,{LF}I'll look for it.
Thank you so much. I asked{LF}him where he might have lost{LF}it, and he said
that he thinks he dropped it{LF}on his trip through Messhina Valley.
Messhina Valley... That's kind{LF}of a dangerous place, isn't it?
Well, I'll go and look {LF}around Messhina Valley.
I'm sorry to make you do this,{LF}but thank you so much.
Please look for a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}One of my customers dropped it{LF}just the other day.
He said he lost it {LF}in the Messhina Valley.
Please look out for yourself too.
I'm patrolling the town to{LF}make sure that nothing out of {LF}the ordinary is going on. Has anything{LF}strange happened to you lately?
You're patrolling the town? That{LF}sounds like hard work. No, there{LF}hasn't been anything in particular.
Ah, that's good to hear.
It's really begun to feel like{LF}the springtime, hasn't it?
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival.{LF}That's always an enjoyable time.
That was some earthquake!
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest...{LF}Sounds like a something Herman would{LF}think up, doesn't it?
Tomorrow's the start of {LF}swimming season. Ceci bought{LF}a bathing suit too.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest.{LF}Do you have a monster you're{LF}particularly proud of, ＠カイル＠＠?
Wow, another earthquake.{LF}I'm starting to think{LF}something's going on...
Wow, it's really summertime, isn't it?{LF}I'm having a little bit of trouble {LF}dealing with this heat.

Another earthquake... Doesn't{LF}it feel like something strange{LF}is happening?
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival,{LF}We must be sure to always {LF}be thankful for the land.
The whole town looks like it's{LF}bathed in orange and red, doesn't it?{LF}Ahh, I love this season.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest.{LF}If you're participating, good luck!
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I hope the weather is clear.
It really feels like winter,{LF}doesn't it? The mornings{LF}have become so difficult.
Tomorrow's the {LF}Mining Contest. It's like{LF}it's a real man's festival,{LF}isn't it?
Another earthquake. And we{LF}went so many years without one...
The year ends tomorrow. I'm{LF}just thankful that we all made it{LF}through this year safe and sound.
It really feels like springtime,{LF}doesn't it? What a wonderful{LF}season.
It's really summertime. Has the{LF}heat been wearing you out much?
The whole town looks bathed in{LF}red, doesn't it? There are so many{LF}wonderful ingredients in this season,{LF}it really makes me want to cook.
Are you having trouble waking{LF}up in the cold mornings?
I may be an elf, but the people{LF}in this town don't discriminate{LF}against me at all.
This really is a wonderful town.{LF}It would be nice if Jake realized{LF}that, but there is only so much a{LF}parent can do...
I may be an elf, but the people{LF}in this town don't discriminate{LF}against me at all.
I'm hoping that by living in{LF}this town, I can help humans{LF}and elves get along even better.
I may be an elf, but the people{LF}in this town don't discriminate{LF}against me at all.
Jake doesn't really like humans,{LF}but I feel like if he gets to know the{LF}people in this town, he'll definitely{LF}change his opinion.
The morning feels great, doesn't it?
The sun is shining high in the sky.
The sun's setting and the day's{LF}work is drawing to a close.
I really like ＠アイテム９＠s. They're{LF}very healthy.
I really like ＠アイテム９＠s. What{LF}about you, ＠カイル＠＠? Is there{LF}anything you like in particular?
I really like ＠アイテム９＠. You{LF}can use it in any sort of cooking.
Have you already made some{LF}friends in this town, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm fairly close with Herman and{LF}Mayor Byron.
Have you already made some{LF}friends in this town, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm fairly close with Herman and{LF}Mayor Byron.
Byron and I talk about our sons{LF}a lot... Bringing up kids is hard.

I'm fairly close with Herman and{LF}Mayor Byron.
Herman enjoys eating just about{LF}anything, so I always like spending{LF}time with him.
The Kingdom of Norad has a{LF}very long history.
The Kingdom of Norad has a{LF}very long history. It's said to{LF}be the birthplace of human beings.
Norad is a country steeped in history.
Rather strange that it was able to{LF}withstand the Sechs Empire despite {LF}lacking a strong military, isn't it?
Running the inn, I get to talk to all {LF}kinds of people from around the {LF}world. I really enjoy it!
Running the inn, I get to talk to all {LF}kinds of people from around the {LF}world. I really enjoy it!
Do you enjoy being a farmer, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Running the inn, I get to talk to all {LF}kinds of people from around the {LF}world. I really enjoy it!
No matter what you do, as long {LF}as you pour your heart into it, {LF}you'll enjoy it. Don't you think?
My guilty little pleasure is {LF}＠アイテム８＠. {LF}I love the aroma.
My guilty little pleasure is {LF}＠アイテム８＠. {LF}The aroma's very soothing.
My guilty little pleasure is {LF}＠アイテム８＠. I could die happy {LF}if I had it... Maybe that's taking it {LF}a little too far, heh heh.
I believe it's our duty as adults to {LF}leave the town a better place for our {LF}children.
I want to live in a town that puts a {LF}smile on all the young ones' faces.
It brings me great joy to see the {LF}children playing and enjoying {LF}themselves.
There's a rumor been going 'round {LF}lately saying there's a ghost that {LF}appears in front of the clinic.
You believe in that kinda stuff, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Apparently there's been a ghost {LF}appearing in front of the clinic {LF}recently.
I sure would like to see something {LF}like that with my own eyes.
The clinic ghost has become {LF}the talk of the town, hasn't it?
Ceci says she's afraid to go out at {LF}this time of night.
The only thing you'd ever see me turn {LF}down is ＠アイテム７＠.
The only thing you'll ever see me turn {LF}down is ＠アイテム７＠S. I've tried to{LF}like them, I really have, but I just{LF}don't like the way they taste.

I was born on the 21st of autumn. {LF}Autumn's when all of life's little {LF}delicacies taste their best.

What do you want to be when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, well, I haven't thought much {LF}about it, to be honest.
Can't say I blame you. This is {LF}the time to be adventurous and {LF}live a little.
What do you want to be when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, well, I haven't thought much {LF}about it, to be honest.
It'd be nice if you could find your path {LF}in life at your age.
What do you want to be when you {LF}grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, well, I haven't thought much {LF}about it, to be honest.
I get the feeling farming may just be {LF}your calling, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm worried about that son of mine. {LF}Jake doesn't like humans...
I'm worried about that son of mine. {LF}Jake doesn't like humans... Ceci on {LF}the other hand, she gets along great {LF}with them.
I'm worried about that son of mine. {LF}Jake doesn't like humans... I wonder if {LF}there's anything I could do to help him {LF}open up?
We elves live to be pretty old. I'm over {LF}100 myself.
We elves live to be pretty old. I'm over {LF}100 myself. You surprised?
We elves live to be pretty old. I'm over {LF}100 myself. Living a long time isn't{LF}without it's drawbacks though.
You become good friends with a {LF}human, then he passes on years {LF}before you.
I do like running the inn. I only wish I {LF}had more guests. It can get lonely {LF}around here sometimes.

Have any of your memories come back, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
No, not a thing.
I see. You'll be all right, though. {LF}Just give it time. They'll return.
Have any of your memories come back, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
No, not a thing.
Must be hard losing your memory.

No, not a thing.

I hope this world will remain {LF}at peace.
I hope this world will remain {LF}at peace. There is so much more to{LF}lose in war than there is to gain.
I hope this world will remain {LF}at peace.
As long as the Sechs Empire{LF}stays quiet, things may just stay {LF}that way.
I find it troubling this town doesn't {LF}have a school.
You've got a point, yeah.
I find it troubling this town doesn't {LF}have a school.
A school...you've got a point.
I find it troubling this town doesn't {LF}have a school. How else are the {LF}children supposed to study?
You've got a point, yeah.
Have you given any thought to{LF}marriage yet, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
Oh, really? Well, perhaps you should{LF}give it some thought. Raising a family{LF}can bring you a great deal of joy.{LF}
Really? Well, I won't ask who you've{LF}been considering. I wouldn't want to{LF}intrude.
That was a beautiful ceremony, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Have you given any thought to{LF}marriage yet, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
Falling in love is a wonderful thing.
Do you happen to have your eye on {LF}anyone in particular?
What did you think of the food at the {LF}reception? I made every morsel myself.
Have you given any thought to{LF}marriage yet, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Yes.
Well, you're still young. No need {LF}to rush something like that.
Getting married and having children {LF}is a big part of life.
Why, I can imagine another little {LF}children of yours running around town{LF}in the not-so-distant future!
There are many other races besides {LF}humans in the world. Elves, dwarves, {LF}halflings...
I do wonder if we'll ever be able to {LF}overcome our differences and live {LF}together in peace.

I don't know the answer to that, but I {LF}hope that day will one day come.
So do I.
There are many other races besides {LF}humans in the world. Elves, dwarves, {LF}halflings...
I do wonder if we'll ever be able to {LF}overcome our differences and live {LF}together in peace.
With more people like you and {LF}Cecilia around, I'm sure we would.
Do you know of the Forest of {LF}Beginnings?
No
Yes
It's a mysterious place.
Oh, you know of it?
Do you know of the Forest of {LF}Beginnings?
No.
Yes.
The forest itself holds many {LF}mysteries. No one really understands{LF}the magic that teleports monsters back{LF}and forth from the forest.
I should have expected as much from {LF}you. You're always on top of things.
Do you know of the Forest of {LF}Beginnings?
No.
Yes.
What do you suppose created the {LF}magic that teleports monsters from{LF}there to these lands, and then sends{LF}them back there when they're defeated?
You sure know a lot, don't you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Sometimes I think you were brought {LF}here to fulfill some great destiny, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Why do you say that?
I can't say I know the reason, but I do {LF}know that's what I feel.
Sometimes I think you were brought {LF}here to fulfill some great destiny, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Why do you say that?
Because you came here after having {LF}lost your memory. I'm sure there {LF}must be reason for that.
Sometimes I think you were brought {LF}here to fulfill some great destiny, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Why do you say that?
You just seem different from everyone {LF}else.
You've become a fully-fledged resident {LF}of the town, ＠カイル＠＠.
You've become a fully-fledged resident {LF}of the town, ＠カイル＠＠.
Everyone here is better having met {LF}you, and it shows on their faces.
You've become a fully-fledged resident {LF}of the town, ＠カイル＠＠.
Ever since you showed up, everyone {LF}just seems brighter than they were {LF}before.
They say legendary dragons called {LF}the Elder Dragons exists. I'd like to {LF}see something like that with my own {LF}eyes sometime.

In all the years I've lived, I've {LF}never seen one. Not once.

Ceci says she saw one once when {LF}she was little.
I'm glad you and I are friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm glad you and I are friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you.
I hope we will always remain so.
I'm glad you and I are friends, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you.
Just goes to show humans and {LF}elves really can understand one {LF}another.
Do you like school? I know Orland {LF}can be a somewhat difficult person {LF}to talk to, but he really would {LF}like to be friends with you.
Your father did a lot for the town.
Orland might seem like he's got a {LF}chip on his shoulder, but he's a nice {LF}kid underneath it all.
It's nice having so many children {LF}around town. Makes the place so {LF}much livelier, you know?
You're looking well as always, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. You remind me so much {LF}of your father. He was an incredible {LF}man. A true hero.
Welcome.
Welcome. Will you be staying?
Welcome.
It's rather cold outside. All the more{LF}reason to stay inside the inn today.
No place like home to kick back and {LF}relax, eh?
This heat just isn't letting up, is it?
This is one of my favorite times of the {LF}year. Are you planning any {LF}excursions anywhere, ＠アルス＠＠?
The cold seems to have settled in for {LF}the winter. The inn always gets fewer {LF}guests this time of year.
Do you like taking baths, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Baths feel particularly nice in the {LF}middle of summer.
You slip into that warm water and the {LF}day's troubles just melt away.
You really appreciate that warm water{LF}better in the cold weather.
What are you doing with yourself {LF}these days? Whatever it is, just {LF}make sure you're not overdoing{LF}it, all right?
Don't venture too far inside {LF}any monster-infested areas.
You're not hanging around any {LF}monster-infested areas, are you?
I get the feeling you're really starting {LF}to come into your own, you know that?
Might just be my mind playing tricks {LF}on me, but whenever I look at you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠, I sense some force {LF}hidden within you.
I'm glad to see that you've turned out{LF}so much like your father, ＠アルス＠＠.
I must say, today's turned out to be {LF}quite a fun day.
I must say, today's turned out to be {LF}quite a fun day.
So you found the ＠アイテム９＠?!
Got it right here.
This will certainly come in handy. I'll {LF}be able to make quite a treat with {LF}this, I think.
You...think?
I've never actually made something {LF}with ＠アイテム９＠ in it before.
Is that right?
Yup. Say, you wouldn't be interested {LF}in being the first to sample it, would {LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠? It won't kill you. {LF}I don't think it will, anyway.
You know what? I think I'll pass.
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Maybe next time, yeah?
You bet. Here, I want you to have this {LF}as a small token of my appreciation.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I've got something else for you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Use this on any monsters you catch {LF}to help tame them.
Don't be shy about using it, okay?
Thanks.
If I ever need anything else, {LF}I'll be sure to put it up on {LF}the bulletin board.
Is this for me? Well thank you.
Oh wait, your backpack {LF}appears to be full.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you!
No problem.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I have a small request, actually.
What is it?
I want you to hold onto that,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What? Me take this? But why?
I...cannot say. Not at the moment, {LF}anyway. But please promise me {LF}you'll look after it.
I promise.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
That's very important to me.
I...I want you to have it. You may {LF}need it someday.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
I wanted to tell you something, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. When I was small, I liked {LF}collecting stones. One time I got lost {LF}in a dungeon while looking for some.
The person who saved me from that {LF}terrible place was a man called Raguna.
I remember you saying you and he {LF}were friends when you lived in Kardia.
After seeing how handsome and how {LF}brave he was...my life changed {LF}forever.
From that point on, I always imagined{LF}my future husband proposing to me{LF}in a dungeon or other monster-infested{LF}area.
That's...that's interesting. {LF}(That's one of the weirdest things {LF}I've ever heard.)
That's not... {LF}strange or anything, is it?
No, not at all. Well, it's not {LF}exactly normal, but it's not {LF}so weird.
Do you like girls who are a{LF}little strange, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
No.
Y-Yeah, you're right. Who in their {LF}right mind would ever like someone {LF}like that, huh?
I'm sorry. I think I'd better go home {LF}now.
Yeah, I do.
Really?! Oh, ＠カイル＠＠...
Will you marry me?
Hold on a second.
Will you marry me, Cecilia?
Oh, you have no idea how happy I {LF}feel... How long I've been waiting{LF}to hear those words!
I promise I'll make you happy.
I believe you.
You're...You're married, aren't you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠? I don't know if {LF}we should be talking like this...
I'm...I'm already married to Jake. {LF}I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.
I see... I'm sorry too.
I really am sorry. I'd better head home.
Don't give it to me here. Give it to me {LF}at ＠マップ９＠,{LF}okay?
＠カイル＠＠ obtained a ＠アイテム９＠.
Is this the ＠アイテム９＠, Cecilia?
Oh, you found it! Thank you so much, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I thought it was gone {LF}for good.
I'm glad we found it. Well, I guess {LF}I'll be going now.
Sorry for the trouble. Be sure to thank {LF}Jake for me too, okay?
I will.
Thanks, I love these.
I'm sorry, but I don't like these.
Thanks, I love these.
I'm sorry, but I don't like these.
This looks delicious.
You know, I feel really good now. {LF}Thanks so much.
Is this for me? Thanks. I'll drink {LF}it right now.
Thanks, it was great.
Is this for me? It looks delicious.
Whoa, I feel...I feel kinda funny, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. What's...What's {LF}happening to me?
I really like those, but I'd prefer {LF}one on my birthday.
I really like those, but I'd prefer {LF}one on my birthday.
Thanks for the ＠アイテム９＠. {LF}Today's my birthday, you know. 
Thanks for the ＠アイテム９＠. {LF}Today's my birthday, you know. 
Thanks, but you should really only {LF}get one present from someone on {LF}their birthday.
Thanks, but you should really only {LF}get one present from someone on {LF}their birthday.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Wow.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is this for me? Wow.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. This is a surprise.
It gets really hot in here in summer.
Autumn has this way of making you {LF}feel isolated from everyone else, {LF}don't you think?
Winter's actually my favorite season. {LF}Heh heh.
Welcome. Don't be shy about {LF}spending the night once in a while, {LF}okay?
It certainly is hot today.
The inn can be a nice place for some {LF}reflection on those long autumn nights.
Look at that beautiful winter scenery {LF}outside.
I've got to clean, wash, and{LF}cook here at De Sainte-Coquille{LF}Manor. I'm pretty busy all{LF}the time!
Herman's gigantic house takes {LF}forever to clean.
With all the vegetables we get in {LF}autumn, it's a great time for some {LF}interesting recipes.
Tabatha's given me recipes {LF}for all sorts of dishes.
The cold days of winter make {LF}all the wet housework tough. {LF}*sigh*
Hi there, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, Cecilia.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠, want me to read {LF}your fortune for tomorrow?
You're wasting your time, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}She's always way off.
It's really hot, huh, ＠カイル＠＠?
Sure is.
Well duh, it's summer. Right, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm not a big fan of the heat.
I think it's the clothes you wear.
Oh, hi there, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi Cecilia.
Anything interesting happen to you {LF}lately, ＠カイル＠＠?
Nothing really comes to mind, no.
We could always go out on a date, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. That might be interesting...
Alicia! What's gotten into you?
It was a joke, Mana.
It really looks like winter now, huh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah, it does.
I don't really like winter. I hope we {LF}get an early spring.
I prefer winter myself.
It's a nice time of year now. {LF}It's lovely at the park.
How about this heat, huh? *sigh*
They say autumn's the season for {LF}food. What's your favorite food, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
It's beginning to look a lot like winter, huh? I like spending time{LF}just chatting in the park.
Oh, hi there, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, Cecilia.
Anything interesting happen to you {LF}lately, ＠カイル＠＠?
Nothing really comes to mind, no.
We could always go out on a date, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. That might be interesting...
Alicia! What's gotten into you?
It was a joke, Mana.
How about you and me go out on a {LF}date, ＠カイル＠＠?
Ceci!
Kidding.
Maybe we should let ＠カイル＠＠ {LF}decide who he goes out with.
Hey, I'm staying out of this one. {LF}(How'd this get started, anyway?!)
I think Woolies are kind of cute,{LF}don't you? They're my favorite{LF}monster.
Oh, hi there, ＠カイル＠＠. Will you {LF}meet me at {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9 o'clock tonight?
You know, I can't believe you broke {LF}your promise.
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day.
What do you want, human!
Jake! You know you shouldn't talk like {LF}that! I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.
It's quite all right.
Pretty hot today, isn't it, ＠カイル＠＠?
You can say that again.
If you're hot, go swim in the ocean, {LF}human.
I...I suppose I could always do that, {LF}yeah.
Oh, hello ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello.
Shouldn't you be working your stupid {LF}field instead of spending your time {LF}harassing us, human?
Sorry if I've bothered you.
The cold's really settled in, eh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Yeah.
If you're cold, go back to your stinking {LF}house, human.
That's one way to stay warm.
Well, quite a surprise running into you {LF}here, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hot again as usual today, isn't it? Be {LF}sure to look after yourself when you're {LF}out in this heat.
Herman eats about three times as {LF}much in autumn as he normally does. {LF}All that extra cooking is a lot of work.
Blowing on my hands and {LF}rubbing them together helps me {LF}stay warm.
A warm bath is so nice and soothing{LF}when I've had a rough day.
Baths in summer are especially nice.
I always end up staying in the bath {LF}longer in autumn.
Nothing beats a bath in winter. I never {LF}want to come out.
I'll admit I just love to chat over {LF}at Mana's house.
For some reason, I find this place {LF}really relaxing.
Maybe it's just something I see in it?
I don't think so.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. It's not often you're {LF}here at Mana's house.
We wouldn't know how often he's here {LF}anyway. We never get to see him {LF}when he is!
Alicia! What's that supposed to mean?!
I think you know exactly what it {LF}means, don't you?
There's going to be a tea party at {LF}Mana's house today.
Are you going to stop by, ＠カイル＠＠?
You're welcome to come, but you {LF}know we'll all be talking about you {LF}after you leave!
Sounds great, but I think I'll pass{LF}on this one.
The best thing to do on a cold day like {LF}today is talk with friends inside.
I hear ya.
So, so true. Don't you think, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Umm...I guess, yeah.
Why do I find that hard to believe...? {LF}Don't you know that women look for {LF}honesty in a man?
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Pretty hot today, huh?
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠. Can you {LF}believe it's already autumn?
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's best to be inside when {LF}it's cold out, huh?
Good day.
Oh, there you are, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Thanks for coming.
Is there something special about this {LF}place?
According to Alicia's reading, we may {LF}be able to see a shooting star here {LF}tonight.
A shooting star?
Yeah. Normally you can only see {LF}them during the Shooting Star Festival, {LF}but today's special.
That's pretty neat.
(I've always wanted to see a shooting {LF}star with you, ＠カイル＠＠...)
You say something?
Oh, no. Just...talking to myself! {LF}It should turn up any minute now.
There, did you see it?!
Yeah...{LF}Wow.
That was great.
Yeah. It was really really something.{LF}
Alicia's reading was spot on.
Crazy, huh?{LF}I'm glad we came.
Yeah. Thanks for coming out here {LF}with me tonight.
My pleasure.
I should be getting home now. Well, {LF}see you tomorrow!
Yeah. Have a good night, Cecilia!
I waited for you, ＠カイル＠＠. You {LF}never came.
I didn't know you were so mean, {LF}breaking a promise like it meant {LF}nothing to you.
I'm really sorry.
I'm going home now, ＠カイル＠＠.
Have you been waiting long, Cecilia?
No, just got here myself.
I hope we get to see a shooting star.
I'm so excited!
Me too.
(Please let us see a shooting star, {LF}please let us see a shooting star...)
Hey, did you see it!
Yeah, there it was.
I'm so glad we got to see it together, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
There goes another!
There are a lot out tonight. Maybe {LF}they were expecting us?
Well...I don't know about that, but... {LF}It was nice, though.
I...I really had a nice time tonight, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
So did I.
Whenever you smile, it makes me {LF}want to smile too, ＠カイル＠＠.
Really? Well, I'm happy to hear that.
(I wish that ＠カイル＠＠ {LF}and I will become {LF}closer to each other.)
Did you make a wish?
Umm...well, actually...yeah. Yeah, I {LF}did. I guess I wished that me and you {LF}might...become closer.
Really? That's...that's the exact {LF}same thing I wished for.
Thanks for inviting me here tonight, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I had a great time.
Me too.
Well, see you tomorrow!
Hi there, I'm Ceci. I mean, Cecilia! {LF}Ceci was how I used to pronounce{LF}my name when I was little...
I'm ＠カイル＠＠. Nice to meet you!
You're not from around here, are you?
No. I'm working on Mana's farm.
You know, you kind of remind{LF}me of Raguna...
Who's Raguna?
Oh, I'm sorry... You see, I used{LF}to live in a town called Kardia{LF}a long time ago, and this guy a{LF}lot like you came to our town.
He helped me out when I got{LF}lost, and other things like{LF}that. I have a lot of good{LF}memories of him...
Ah, I see.
Listen to me, going on about{LF}ancient history like that!{LF}Anyway, this is a nice place,{LF}too. I hope you feel at home here.
Thanks, me too!
Hello.
Thanks for coming, ＠カイル＠＠.
No problem. So what did you want to {LF}see me about?
Umm, I was wondering if you like {LF}＠アイテム９＠?
Yeah.
Not really.
I like you, Cecilia.
Yeah, I love it!
Really?! That's great. I was worried {LF}that maybe you didn't like it, and {LF}then what I'd do if you didn't...
Because...I baked this for you.{LF}Will you accept it?
Hey, an ＠アイテム９＠! {LF}It looks delicious.
I...I hope you like it...
Well thank you very much. {LF}I'm sure I will.
I think you will too. I'll be sure and {LF}bake you another sometime!
Thanks. I'll look forward to it.
Oh, looks like your backpack's full, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Actually, I'm not a big fan.
Oh, I see...
So what did you need me for?
Umm, I'm sorry, it's...it's nothing. {LF}I can take care of it myself.
Oh, okay.
Sorry for calling you over here {LF}like this.
I like you, Cecilia.
Umm, wow, well...that isn't exactly {LF}the answer I was expecting to hear...
But that doesn't mean I'm not {LF}happy to hear it...
Heh, don't you hate these awkward {LF}moments? Well...thanks, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
(I was actually kinda joking around, {LF}but I can't really tell her that now, {LF}can I?)
I'd like to make something else for {LF}you sometime, ＠カイル＠＠.
I think it'd be fun to bake for you{LF}every day!
If you have any requests, let me {LF}know and I'll make it for you {LF}sometime, ＠カイル＠＠.
Actually, I...＠カイル＠＠, I...I...no, {LF}it's nothing.
Thanks for coming all the way over {LF}here today.
Hey there.
I've been waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠.
So what did you want to talk about?
Jake...Jake has asked for my hand {LF}in marriage.
What?! Seriously?
I haven't given him an answer yet, so {LF}nothing's official...
What should I do, ＠カイル＠＠?
What's there to think about?
Don't do it!
Marry me instead.
Yeah, you're right. That's how I feel {LF}too. Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
How...How could you say something {LF}like that, ＠カイル＠＠?! {LF}Knowing how I feel!
Cecilia...
I know you know how I feel about you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠...
About...me?
I'll be waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}For the day when you see me the {LF}way I see you.
What, so you're saying you'd marry {LF}me instead?
Well...I dunno...
I can't believe you'd say something {LF}like that. This is my life we're {LF}talking about here. Goodbye, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
So does that mean you'll marry {LF}me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, well, I...I'm not entirely su...
I'm so happy! I'll be waiting, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Waiting for the day when {LF}we start our new lives together.
I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠. I don't know if {LF}we're right for each other. {LF}I'd better be going.
Really?!
Umm, well, some day soon...{LF}I want to propose to you the right{LF}way, though.
I'm so happy! I'll be waiting, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Waiting for {LF}the day you propose to me.
Hey there.
I've been waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Did you bring the ＠アイテム９＠?
Yeah.
Whoops, I forgot it.
Do you think you could you go back {LF}and get it? I'll be waiting here.
May I have it?
I'm glad you remembered it!
Good morning, sweetheart.
"Sweetheart"! Oh, listen to me. {LF}We certainly sound like newlyweds, {LF}don't we?
I'm so happy we're together like this.
Are you happy we got married?
I'm dying to have a baby.
I admire all the hard work you {LF}do every day, sweetheart.
I wonder how my life would've been {LF}different if I hadn't met you.
Take care when you're out there, {LF}sweetheart.
You know, I haven't been feeling so {LF}great lately... I've been nauseous {LF}a lot.
Should we go see Natalie?
No, I'm sure I'll be fine. I've a pretty {LF}good idea what it might be, anyway...
I'm so happy we're together like this.
Good luck with the school, {LF}sweetheart. One day {LF}＠アルス＠＠ will be going there.
Oh, by the way, Byron said he {LF}wanted to talk to you about it {LF}on the first floor of his house.
I've got something I need to talk to {LF}you about, sweetheart.
What is it?
Well, I...I think I'm pregnant.
Really! That's great, Cecilia! {LF}I'm so happy.
Me too.
So what do you think it is? {LF}Boy or girl?
Ha ha... What do you hope it is?
A boy
A girl
It doesn't matter
I guess I hope it's a boy. {LF}What about you?
I guess I hope it's a girl. {LF}What about you?
Either's a blessing. {LF}What about you?
That's how I feel, too.
Looks like our little household's {LF}about to get bigger.
I can't wait, honey.
Me neither!
The baby'll be here any day now, {LF}sweetheart!
The baby's here, sweetheart!
That's wonderful, Cecilia!
Look at him. He's the spitting image {LF}of his daddy.
Look at her. She's the spitting image {LF}of her daddy.
Sure is.
We need to think of a name. Any {LF}ideas, sweetheart?
＠アルス＠＠... That's a beautiful name. {LF}I like it.
Great.
Hey little ＠アルス＠＠... One day you'll {LF}be big and strong just like your father.
Hmm...
Something wrong?
Yeah. We don't have a school around {LF}here.
That's true.
I'll have a talk with Byron about {LF}building a school. {LF}Where's ＠アルス＠＠ gonna learn?
Exactly. Well, good luck, sweetheart. {LF}Think of ＠アルス＠＠.
Right!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good day.
Good day.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, good day.
Good day.
Oh, good evening.
Good evening.

It's nice seeing you, too.
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.
It's time for children to be in their {LF}beds, you know.
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠!
Today's the Flower Festival. {LF}Are you going with anyone, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Lemme think...
I haven't made any plans
Aren't the cherry blossoms beautiful?
Today's the Flower Festival.
I thought maybe you and me could {LF}go together.
Really?! That'd be great!
Let's meet up at {LF}＠マップ９＠, then.
What do you mean you haven't made {LF}any plans? You've already been with {LF}somebody else, haven't you?
Yes, I think so too. {LF}I like their transient nature.
Cherry blossoms are meant to be {LF}appreciated together, you know.
Let's meet up at {LF}＠マップ９＠, then.
I had a great time. {LF}Thanks for inviting me.
Today's the Flower Festival. Are you {LF}going with anyone, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Eating Contest. Herman's {LF}been looking forward to it all year.
Congratulations on your victory.  {LF}I couldn't believe Herman's face. He {LF}was so happy for you.
Sorry about the contest.
Today's the Eating Contest. Are you {LF}going to participate, ＠アルス＠＠?
I can't believe you won!
Sorry you lost.

Swimming season starts today. Do you {LF}like swimming, ＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}Do you plan on entering, ＠カイル＠＠?
You won! That's amazing.
Too bad about the contest. {LF}There's always next time.
Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}I don't know if you should be entering {LF}something like that, ＠アルス＠＠.
So you won. That's great, but just be {LF}careful, okay?
You lost, huh? I wouldn't beat {LF}yourself up over it, though.
Today's the Dance Festival. I really {LF}feel like dancing.
Say, may I have this dance?
Say... Never mind.
Oh, sure. It'd be a pleasure. If you {LF}don't mind dancing with someone {LF}like me, that is.
Thanks for asking me, but I really {LF}can't accept.
I see...
Thanks for asking me to dance.{LF}That was fun.
Sorry I turned you down earlier.
Oh, you already danced with someone{LF}else? But I was really hoping...{LF}Never mind.
The Dance Festival...reminds me {LF}of younger days.
Today's the Fishing Contest. Good {LF}luck if you plan on entering!
You won! You're amazing, ＠カイル＠＠.
You've got a long way to go yet, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
So today's the Big Cook-Off. Are you {LF}going to enter, ＠アルス＠＠?
You're quite the chef, ＠アルス＠＠!
You shouldn't dwell too much on life's {LF}defeats. I'll share one of my secret {LF}recipes with you sometime.
Today's the Adventure Contest. {LF}Are you going to participate, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Congratulations on winning. That's {LF}incredible.
Sorry you didn't do so well this time.
So today's the Adventure Contest. {LF}I think you should sit this one out, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. It's too dangerous.
So you won? That's great, but I don't {LF}really like you doing all these {LF}dangerous things.
I'm glad to see you didn't get injured.
Today's the Harvest Festival. The time {LF}to give our thanks to Mother Earth.

Didn't go so well, did it?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.
Say, you...you want to go together?
Say... Never mind.
Oh, with you? Umm...well...
No?
No, if you want to go, we can go.
Great.
I'll be waiting for you at {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}at 9 o'clock tonight.
Thanks for inviting me, but I can't {LF}accept.
I see...
I'm looking forward to tonight. {LF}9 o'clock, remember. I hope it isn't {LF}cloudy or anything.
Sorry for turning you down like that.
I'm glad we got to see a shooting {LF}star together, ＠カイル＠＠.
You haven't already invited anyone {LF}else, have you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}Try making a wish on a star and {LF}see if it comes true, ＠アルス＠＠!
Today's the Mining Contest. I'll{LF}bet you're pretty good with a{LF}hammer, ＠カイル＠＠.
You won? Congratulations!
Don't let it get you down. I'll always {LF}be cheering you on.
Today's the Mining Contest. You {LF}going to enter, ＠アルス＠＠?
You won? That's amazing, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Oh, so you didn't win? Well, you can't {LF}win 'em all, you know?
Today's the last day of the year. {LF}Here's to the next one, eh?
Today's the end of the year. All the {LF}best to you in the next one, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
You took a look at the bulletin board, {LF}didn't you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes.
So you know I'd like you to go get {LF}a ＠アイテム９＠ from{LF}＠マップ９＠ for me.
However, I don't want you to kill any {LF}monsters to get it, okay?
I can't kill any monsters?
That's right.
Okay. I'll see how it goes.
Best of luck to you.
Please find the ＠アイテム９＠ at {LF}＠マップ９＠ for me.
Make sure you don't kill any {LF}monsters, though.
I see you found the ＠アイテム９＠. {LF}May I have it?
You're exactly the kind of person I {LF}thought you were, ＠カイル＠＠.
I've been waiting for you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What is it?
We need an ＠アイテム９＠ for Herman's {LF}latest delicacy.
You can find them at {LF}＠マップ９＠,{LF}but I haven't got the{LF}time to get one myself.
Do you think I could ask you to go {LF}get it?
No problem. You can count on me.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠. It'll be a great {LF}help.
Go find a ＠アイテム９＠ at {LF}＠マップ９＠.
It's the secret ingredient in Herman's {LF}dish.
I see you found the ＠アイテム９＠. {LF}May I have it?
You're kinda cute, you know that, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Uh...I am?
Very. I have something else I was {LF}hoping you could do for me. Hee hee. 
I...have kind of a difficult task... {LF}Do you think you're up for it?
Well, let's hear what it is.
Umm...well...I was wondering if you {LF}wouldn't mind spending the night at {LF}my house?
What?! W-Well, I...I dunno about {LF}that...
Oh, no no no. I meant as a guest. {LF}You know, since it's an inn.
Oh, yeah, 'course it is. Ha ha ha. {LF}You had me confused for a second {LF}there.
We haven't had very many guests {LF}this month, and Egan seems a little {LF}worried.
Since I'm lodging there, I figured I {LF}should try and help bring in business {LF}any way I can.
No problem.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠. It'll be a real {LF}big help. Whenever you want to stay, {LF}just go talk to Egan.
Go talk to Egan at the inn, okay?
Thanks for helping out like that, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Egan was so happy.
You really are a nice guy, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}It's great knowing someone like you.
I always feel so at ease when I talk {LF}to you. It's strange.
Is that right...
I have something else I want to ask {LF}you, he he.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠... It's like...do you {LF}think maybe...
What is it, Cecilia?
Do you think you could come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}at 9 o'clock tonight?
9 o'clock tonight?
Yes. I have a bit of a...strange {LF}request. Will you be there?
Sure.
Great. So I'll see you at 9, then.
Right.
Be at ＠マップ９＠ {LF}at 9 o'clock tonight, {LF}okay? I'll be waiting for you.
I can't believe you broke your {LF}promise...
I'm glad we got a chance to see a {LF}shooting star together, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you think I could {LF}get you to talk to Jake for me?
Jake? Sure. What about?
Well, nothing in particular.{LF}He has this intense dislike of {LF}humans, but I've been thinking... {LF}maybe he might open up to you?
Okay. I dunno how it'll go, {LF}but I'll give it a shot.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Please try and talk to Jake.
If you can become friends with him,{LF}maybe he'll change his views on{LF}humans.
Thanks for talking to Jake for me.
Sure, but I don't know how much it {LF}helped.
Oh, he won't change overnight, I know. {LF}But none of the other boys in {LF}town will even talk to him.
I thought maybe if you two talked to {LF}each other, you might become friends.
Sorry for asking you to do something {LF}like this, but please, see what you {LF}can do to get closer to him.
Okay. I'll do everything I can to get {LF}him to talk to me.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠. I always {LF}knew you were a good person.
Talking with you always takes my {LF}worries away, ＠カイル＠＠.
Really...
Yeah. It's the kind of person you are.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, you mind if I ask {LF}you a bit of a strange question?
S-Sure, go ahead.
Umm...is there anyone you...like?
I like Mana's character.
I think Julia has a kind heart.
Alicia is always interesting to{LF}talk to.
Dorothy is so innocent.
I like you.
I like Rosalind.
I like Yue.
You like a lot of people, huh?
There's three people you like? {LF}That's a bit of a shock.
So there's two people you like, huh?
I'm glad I'm one of them!
So do you...do you really like me?
I can't say there's anyone I like at the {LF}moment, no.
I see. Well, sorry for calling you {LF}all the way here to ask you that.
Sorry for calling you all the way here {LF}to ask you that.
No, it wasn't a problem.
That's good to know.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you think... {LF}maybe you could come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}later on?
Sure, but what for?
I'll...I'll tell you when I see you there, {LF}okay?
Okay. {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}it is, then.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll be waiting for you at {LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}We need to be there for what I want {LF}to do.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, do you think... {LF}maybe you could come to {LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}later on?
I...need to talk to you somewhere{LF}private.
Sounds important. Sure, I'll be {LF}there.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠. See you later, {LF}then.
I'll be waiting for you at {LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}Make sure you keep it a secret, okay?
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, there's something I'd {LF}like you to try to find for me.
What is it?
Well, it's called a ＠アイテム９＠.
＠アイテム９＠? What's that?
It's just an ordinary stone, {LF}but...it's special to me.
Okay. Sure.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠. You'll probably {LF}find it at {LF}＠マップ９＠. 
Please go and get a ＠アイテム９＠ {LF}from ＠マップ９＠.
You found a ＠アイテム９＠, huh? {LF}May I have it?
This is very important to me.
I want you to hold on to it for now.
Okay.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. You read {LF}the bulletin board, didn't you?
Yeah.
Well thank you. {LF}But...this isn't really the time.
I need a little more time... {LF}until I gather up my feelings.
If you really like me, ＠カイル＠＠, bring {LF}the ＠アイテム９＠ to {LF}＠マップ９＠.
You mean that thing you gave me {LF}before?
Yes. Bring that to {LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}I'll be waiting for you there.
Okay.
Please bring the ＠アイテム９＠ to {LF}＠マップ９＠.
This ＠アイテム９＠ is very important to {LF}me.
I want you to hold on to it for now.
Okay. Sure.
Would you like to make a{LF}＠アイテム９＠, ＠アルス＠＠?
Sure!
Sure!
Let's make it at school. I'll{LF}meet you there.
Let's go make it at school.
Is there something I can do for you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Jake says you're looking for {LF}something, Cecilia.
I asked him what it was, and{LF}he told me to quit bothering him{LF}and ask you.
Jake said that? {LF}He didn't have to be so rude.
I'm looking for a ＠アイテム９＠.
I dropped it when I went to Trieste {LF}Forest.
Trieste Forest? Okay. I'll go have a {LF}look.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Don't mention it.
Thank you so much, ＠カイル＠＠. You {LF}were a big help.
Be sure to let Jake know what {LF}happened, okay?
Egan asked me to give you a {LF}message for him, Cecilia.
He asked if you could bring over {LF}some ＠アイテム９＠, {LF}since he's almost run out.
I see. Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll be on my way, then.
Tell Egan I'll take care of it, {LF}will you? Thank you again, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You having any problems with {LF}anything, Cecilia? I'm just checking {LF}things around town at the moment.
No, can't say that I am. It's nice to {LF}see you're so thoughtful, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠. Is there something I {LF}can do for you?
Well, no, nothing that you can do for {LF}me, but...I was wondering {LF}if I could talk to you.
To me? What about?
Umm... Nothing important. I just {LF}thought we should talk about...uhh...{LF}stuff.
Hee hee, I get it. Alicia asked you, {LF}didn't she?
What?! How'd you know?
That's what her reading said.
I thought it'd be Ray or someone, but {LF}I'm surprised to see it's you.
Sorry if you're disappointed.
No, it's okay. You're a nice guy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Most people would tell {LF}Alicia to get lost.
Ha ha, I do find it hard to {LF}say no to her.
I know what you mean. She's my {LF}friend. And a good person.
Yeah.
I'll be sure to tell her her reading{LF}was accurate.
Thank you.
Feel free to come over to talk {LF}anytime you want, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}It doesn't have to be because {LF}Alicia asked you!
Oh, okay! Sure!
Don't be a stranger.
Spring really clears away all the {LF}laziness of winter, don't you think?
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival. {LF}I'll need to make some good {LF}snacks to take along.
That was some earthquake {LF}we had yesterday.
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest. {LF}Herman's looking forward to it.
Tomorrow's the start of swimming{LF}season. Can't say I've ever been{LF}very comfortable in a swimsuit...

Feel that earthquake?{LF}That one was pretty scary.
It really feels like summer now. {LF}Day after day of these {LF}scorching temperatures...
Tomorrow's the Dance Festival. {LF}I wonder who I'll dance with.
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest. {LF}The best way to get a hold of the {LF}tastiest fish is to catch them {LF}yourself.
Are you going to enter the Adventure {LF}Contest, ＠カイル＠＠?
Another earthquake... I've got an {LF}awful feeling about this...
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival. {LF}You're the reason we always have {LF}hearty vegetables to eat, ＠カイル＠＠.
I always feel lonely for some reason {LF}in autumn.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest. {LF}Woolies are my favorite monster. {LF}They're so cute.
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}It's definitely the most romantic of all {LF}our festivals.
I love the way snow just blankets {LF}everything in a layer of white.
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest. You {LF}strike me as being good at that sort {LF}of thing, ＠カイル＠＠.
There goes another earthquake. {LF}What do you think is behind them?
Tomorrow's the last day of the year. {LF}Did you have a good year, ＠カイル＠＠?
This is a nice time of the year, eh, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Boy, it's so hot, isn't it? The heat {LF}never seems to bother you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Do you enjoy school, ＠アルス＠＠?
You ever get into any snowball fights, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Do you like things here in{LF}Alvarna, ＠カイル＠＠?
Sure, it's pretty nice.
I originally come from Kardia,{LF}but I'm staying here right now.
Kardia's a nice place, but so is{LF}Alvarna. I hope you like it here,{LF}too.
You like things here in Alvarna, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
What do you mean?
I originally come from Kardia, but I'm {LF}living here now.
I have a lot of friends back in Kardia, {LF}but I've also made a lot of friends{LF}here.
You like things here in Alvarna, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
What do you mean?
I originally come from Kardia, but I'm {LF}living here now.
I wonder how Nicole's doing these {LF}days...
You eat a good breakfast every {LF}morning? At Herman's house it all {LF}starts with breakfast.
Did you get plenty to eat, ＠カイル＠＠?
You eat a good lunch every day? {LF}At Herman's house they don't skimp {LF}on lunch either.
Did you get plenty to eat, ＠カイル＠＠?
You eat a good dinner every night? {LF}At Herman's house every dinner {LF}is like a banquet.
I actually prefer a lighter meal before {LF}bed.
Do you know what my favorite thing in {LF}the world is? It's ＠アイテム０＠S.
And RUBIES. Oh yeah, and {LF}＠アイテム２＠S.
Oh yeah. I can't forget ＠アイテム３＠S. {LF}Plus ＠アイテム４＠. I like that, too.
Those...those are all expensive gems.
I've liked shiny little stones{LF}ever since I was little.

And RUBIES. Oh yeah, and {LF}＠アイテム２＠S.
Oh yeah. I can't forget ＠アイテム３＠S. {LF}Plus ＠アイテム４＠. I like that, too.
Those...those are all expensive gems.
I've liked shiny little stones{LF}ever since I was little.

I'm good friends with Mana and Alicia.

I'm good friends with Mana and Alicia.
Mana'll try and con you into buying {LF}something if you're not careful, he he.
You made any friends yet, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm good friends with Mana and Alicia.
Alicia's fortunes can be hit or miss. {LF}Still, you should get her to do a {LF}reading for you sometime, if you like {LF}that kind of thing, that is.
They say mankind first appeared in {LF}Norad.
Where do you suppose elves came {LF}from?

Do you believe in ghosts, ＠カイル＠＠?
I wonder sometimes.
You never hear about them appearing {LF}during the day, do you?
Do you believe in ghosts, ＠カイル＠＠?
I wonder sometimes.
People say there's a ghost that {LF}appears in front of the clinic.
Do you believe in ghosts, ＠カイル＠＠?

These sorts of stories are always a {LF}million times scarier at night, huh?
By the way, I really hate ＠アイテム０＠.

Say, ＠カイル＠＠, I was wondering... {LF}What...What do you think of me?
Umm, well...
I don't know, really.
Sorry, I know that's a weird thing to {LF}ask someone.
Oh, well...okay.
Say, ＠カイル＠＠, I was wondering... {LF}What...What do you think of me?
Umm, well...
I don't know, really.
Sorry, I shouldn't ask you something {LF}like that.

Umm, well...
I don't know, really.
I like you.
Sorry, I shouldn't do something like {LF}that. Forget I asked.
Oh, well...okay.
What?! Please don't tease me like {LF}that, ＠カイル＠＠.
Do you enjoy farm work, ＠カイル＠＠? {LF}You look like you do.
Must be hard when the sun reaches {LF}its peak in the middle of the day, huh?
Whenever I think of farming, I think {LF}of getting up at the crack of dawn to {LF}start working.
Jake has this strong dislike of {LF}humans. I wish he wouldn't be that {LF}way.
Is that right?
He's a good elf deep down.
Jake has this strong dislike of {LF}humans. I wish he wouldn't be that {LF}way.

He's very proud of his elf heritage. {LF}It just comes out the wrong way.
I hope he's able to open up to {LF}humans and monsters someday.
Jake has this strong dislike of {LF}humans. I wish he wouldn't be that {LF}way.

What do you want to do when you're {LF}older, ＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't decided on anything. Right {LF}now I'm enjoying just working the land.
It does look fun, yeah.
What do you want to do when you're {LF}older, ＠カイル＠＠?
I haven't decided on anything. Right {LF}now I'm enjoying just working the {LF}land. What about you, Cecilia?
I want to build a town where humans {LF}and monsters can live together in peace.

Seriously? That's good to hear.
That obvious, huh? I used to be {LF}able to eat whatever I want and not {LF}gain any weight. Darn...
Can I talk to you for a second? I {LF}kinda got into a fight with Mana.
What happened?
It's all just a misunderstanding, but {LF}neither of us wants to apologize.
Just be up front and say you're sorry {LF}about what's happened.
Yeah, you're right. That's what I {LF}should do.
Can I talk to you for a second? I {LF}kinda got into a fight with Mana.
What happened?
That's it, it all started from the most {LF}pointless thing. I hardly even {LF}remember what it was, but neither of {LF}us wants to apologize.
Just be up front and say you're sorry {LF}about what's happened.
Yeah, you're right. That's what I {LF}should do.
Can I talk to you for a second? I {LF}kinda got into a fight with Mana.

I thought about it myself and I can't {LF}figure it out for the life of me. But {LF}neither of us wants to apologize.

Yeah, you're right. That's what I {LF}should do.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, have...have you {LF}thought about marriage yet?
Not really.
Yeah.
You're a sweet guy, ＠カイル＠＠.
Really?
R-Really? Do...do you have anyone {LF}in...no, never mind.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, have...have you {LF}thought about marriage yet?

Working as a maid has helped me {LF}understand people and their{LF}actions better.
Now I see why Tabatha was a maid. {LF}She was someone I knew in {LF}Kardia. That's where I used to live.
Working as a maid has helped me {LF}understand people and their{LF}actions better.
I knew a woman named Tabatha,{LF}back in Kardia, who had a job as a maid.{LF}Lately, I've come to understand{LF}why she enjoyed her work.
So I'm glad that I'm able {LF}to work as a maid too.
You can learn a lot about{LF}how people think, and how they act.
I knew a woman named Tabatha,{LF}back in Kardia, who had a job as a maid.{LF}Lately, I've come to understand{LF}why she enjoyed her work.
I get a real feeling of{LF}purpose when I'm working{LF}to help other people.
Do you know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
I hear that it's something of{LF}a paradise for monsters.{LF}I wish I could go there and {LF}see it for myself at least once.
Oh, you know about it already?
Do you know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
If I were able to go there, {LF}maybe I could learn how to{LF}communicate with monsters.
Oh, you know about it already?
Do you know about the {LF}Forest of Beginnings?
No, I don't.
Yes, I do.
It's where monsters come from, and{LF}where they go when they're defeated.{LF}No one really knows how that magic{LF}works.
Oh, you know about it already?
Are you happy with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I think it would be better{LF}if it were a little easier{LF}to live with monsters here.
Are you happy with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I don't have any problem{LF}with the town itself,{LF}but I just wish Jake would{LF}be a little nicer to everyone.
Are you happy with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I'm pretty much completely{LF}satisfied with this town.{LF}Isn't that something?
Since you're a farmer,{LF}I bet you can feel the{LF}power of the earth.
That's impressive,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It really is.
Since you're a farmer,{LF}I bet you can feel the{LF}power of the earth.
The earth is brimming with{LF}the power of the runes.{LF}We live upon this land,{LF}and we owe it our lives.
Since you're a farmer,{LF}I bet you can feel the{LF}power of the earth.
There's something impressive{LF}about someone who can live{LF}together with the land.
Have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
I saw one once back{LF}when I was a child.
An Elder Dragon saved{LF}my village, Kardia, from {LF}the Sechs Empire.
Have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
I saw one once back{LF}when I was a child.

Have you heard of the Elder Dragons?
I saw one once back{LF}when I was a child.
An Elder Dragon saved{LF}my village, Kardia, from {LF}the Sechs Empire.
I would never have expected{LF}one of the Elder Dragons to {LF}ever give help to humans.
Um...＠カイル＠＠?
What is it?
I'm glad that we met,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Me too.
Really?{LF}I'm happy to hear you say that.
Um...＠カイル＠＠?
What is it?
I'm glad that we met,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Me too.
Really?{LF}I'm very happy to hear you say that.

Me too.
Really?{LF}I'm very happy to hear you say that.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Make lots of friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
You've grown up so quickly,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Have you been able to make many friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}are you having fun at school?{LF}I never had a chance to go to school.{LF}I'm a little jealous of you.{LF}
You're the most important thing{LF}to me in the whole world, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're my little treasure.
We'll take good care of each other,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Don't neglect your studies,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Have fun playing out there,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Just don't go too far away.
Isn't this a nice season,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
It's cold out there.{LF}Be sure to dress nice and warm{LF}before you go out and play.
You should go out and play every day,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}That's what's best for a child.{LF}But don't forget your homework, too.
Are you having fun at school,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Have you made new friends?
It's gotten colder out.{LF}Be careful not to catch a cold.
It's freezing outside.{LF}Be sure to bundle up before you go out.{LF}You never dress warm enough!
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}play nice with Orland, would you?
Orland can be a little{LF}difficult sometimes,{LF}but play nice with him,{LF}all right?
It's cold outside today,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Even though I'm married, {LF}I've still kept my job as a maid.
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}What brings you to Herman's manor?
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You can't play inside here.
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠. Did you come{LF}here to play?
There's nothing better than{LF}a nice, warm bath.
Nobody's going to want to play with {LF}you, ＠アルス＠＠, if you don't{LF}take a bath every now and then.
Taking a bath can be very relaxing.{LF}Don't you think so too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Be sure to dry off after getting out of{LF}the bath, or you'll catch a cold!
Sometimes it's nice to come{LF}to the park and just relax.
When I have a lot of housework to do,{LF}I don't even have time to come unwind{LF}at the park. But you don't have to {LF}worry about that yet, ＠アルス＠＠.
Do you ever go to play in the park?
I love how the park looks when it's{LF}covered in snow.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you've been staying out late recently.{LF}Be sure to go home before dark.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you haven't been playing {LF}in dangerous places, have you?{LF}I'm starting to worry about you.
Have you made many friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you've been leaving town a lot lately.{LF}Don't go too far.
It's gotten peaceful around here.{LF}Isn't it nice?
I knew that your father would come back.{LF}Isn't it wonderful, ＠アルス＠＠?
＠カイル＠＠ came back home! It's so{LF}wonderful to have him back!
Do you have a favorite kind of monster,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Mine's the Wooly.
Thanks for coming, ＠アルス＠＠.
That's a neat outfit!
That's such a cute outfit!

I am! Thank you!
I am! Thank you!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Before we start, you should clear {LF}out some room in your backpack. {LF}I have something to give you {LF}when we're done.
If you make it that way, it'll{LF}come out all wrong. Haven't you {LF}been paying attention in class,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Sorry...
Sorry...
It's okay. Do you want to try{LF}again?
Let me try again!
Maybe later...
All right. Remember what you learned{LF}in your lessons next time!
Remember what you learned in your{LF}lessons next time, ＠アルス＠＠!

Wouldn't it be great if {LF}humans, elves, and monsters{LF}could all get along with each other?
You brought it back?{LF}It took you long enough,{LF}but I shouldn't have expected{LF}any better from you, human.
I guess you did all right.{LF}Well, I'll let you have{LF}your reward anyway.
You got: ＠数字９＠G!
All right? Don't let it get{LF}to your head. Now go.
You finally brought it back?{LF}You've got a lot left to learn.
I could have done it in half the time.
But since you managed to make it back,{LF}I suppose I'll let you have your reward.
You got: ＠数字９＠G!
Don't spend it all in one place,{LF}slowpoke.
What, do you think I care?
You're giving this to me?{LF}You're a strange one, little human.
All right. Go tell Barrett you{LF}gave it to me.
Hey, this is a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}What's this for, little human?
Barrett told me to give it to you.
Barrett told me to give it to you.
Ah, I see.
What do you need it for?
What do you need it for?
I'm going to cut through it with one{LF}of my swords.
You can cut through that? Amazing!
You can cut through that? Amazing!
It's perfect for my training.{LF}Anyway, I'm pretty strong, so{LF}don't think just anyone can cut{LF}through something like this.
Thanks for bringing it to me.
You're giving this to me?{LF}You're a strange one, little human.
You managed to find a piece?{LF}Good work, little human.
Now I can continue with my work.{LF}Here, you can have this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you!
Thank you!
You don't need to thank me.{LF}You made yourself useful,{LF}little human.
It looks like you're carrying too much.{LF}Get rid of something.
You're giving this to me?{LF}You're a strange one, little human.
Good work, little human.
Orland could learn a thing or{LF}two from you.
Here's your payment.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, little human.
It looks like you're carrying too much.{LF}Get rid of something.
What is it, human?
This is from Max.
Is that ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}Thank you. Eating this{LF}should double my stamina.
Now go.{LF}You're in the way of my spear training.
What, you're giving this to me?{LF}I'll take it.{LF}I guess I should thank you, human.
What, you're giving this to me?{LF}I'll take it.{LF}I'm grateful, I suppose.
What, you're giving this to me?{LF}Hmm, I think I can use {LF}it to test my blade.

Jake, try drinking some of this.
What is that, human?{LF}Hand it over.
Well as long as you don't get in my way,{LF}you can do what you like, human.
Here, take this.
Here, take this.
What is it?{LF}Should I drink it?
You've been friendly with Orland.{LF}I appreciate it.
Don't give this to me when it's not{LF}going to mean anything. You're supposed{LF}to give it to me on a special day.{LF}Like my birthday, for example.

Don't you have anything{LF}better to do, human?
What are you in here for, human?
Did you come to buy{LF}a sword or something?
Is the sword you already have{LF}not good enough for you anymore?
If you're looking for a good sword,{LF}I've got one for you, human.
If you're looking for a sword,{LF}you've got the money to pay for it,{LF}right?

If you need something to do, you're{LF}looking in the wrong place, human.
What a nice breeze...
What a nice breeze...{LF}The wind spirit must be in good form...
What a pleasant breeze...{LF}It helps me focus my senses...
What a pleasant cold breeze...{LF}It helps me clear my mind...
Don't forget to equip yourself{LF}before going into a forest or cave,{LF}human.
This area is like{LF}a gateway into the town.
What are you doing in a place like this?{LF}Do you have some kind of errand here?
You'll be risking your life{LF}if you go any further.
Who are you?
Nice to meet you!{LF}I'm ＠カイル＠＠.
I don't remember asking{LF}your name, human.
Uh, sorry about that...
But since you told me your name,{LF}you might as well know mine.{LF}I'm Jake.
I'm a half-elf. Do you have a{LF}problem with that, human?
Uh, no! Not at all!
Good.
Good morning.

Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're still out?
It's a new year.
Happy New Year, Jake.
I don't care if it is a new year.{LF}I still don't want to get {LF}to know humans better.
It's a new year.{LF}This is a good time for new resolutions.
The Flower Festival is today.{LF}What's the point of that, anyway? {LF}Can't you look at flowers any day?{LF}I don't understand you humans.
I think it's because we like {LF}to do things together.
Isn't it just an excuse for you all{LF}to get drunk in the afternoon?
No, I don't think that's quite it...{LF}Ha ha ha.
The Flower Festival is today.{LF}What's the point of that, anyway? {LF}Can't you look at flowers any day?{LF}I don't understand you humans.
The Eating Contest is today.{LF}What a joke. That sounds exactly {LF}like the kind of competition {LF}a human would think up.
That was a waste of time.
Ha ha, you weren't even close.

I guess you didn't have it in you.
It's hot. It's so hot.{LF}I guess we can go swimming starting {LF}today. Don't overdo it out there, human.
I won't.{LF}But it's fun to play in the sea,{LF}don't you think?{LF}Can you swim, Jake?
Of course I can swim. I'm an elf.
(Is he saying that all elves can swim?)
I heard that swimming season starts{LF}today, but Orland doesn't seem {LF}very interested in swimming.
Today is the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. You don't look {LF}like you'd be able to get along {LF}with monsters that well.
You did all right.{LF}It must be beginner's luck.
That's too bad.{LF}But I guess it's difficult for humans to{LF}make friends with monsters, anyway.
Ha ha ha.{LF}And I wasn't even trying!
Today is the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. You don't look {LF}like you'd be able to get along {LF}with monsters that well.
Not bad, little human.{LF}For a minute there, it seemed {LF}like you almost understood them.
That's too bad, but what else {LF}can you expect from {LF}a human child?
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}I'll bet you're thinking of{LF}asking Ceci out.
Well, it's not going to happen.{LF}Stay away from Ceci, human.
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}Who are you going to ask out, {LF}little human?
Today is the Fishing Contest.{LF}Sounds stupid.
Anybody can fish.{LF}It's all based on luck, anyway.
Too bad, human.
Today is the Big Cook-Off.{LF}I guess that doesn't sound {LF}like too terrible of a contest.
I didn't know you were good at cooking.
That's too bad, little human.
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}My swordsmanship skills {LF}should come in handy.
If you're planning on competing, {LF}you'd better stay out of {LF}my way, human.
I can't believe I lost to you.{LF}Not bad...for a human.
You just don't have it in you, human.
Today is the Adventure Contest.{LF}Children had best stay away.
Hey, that's not bad for a human.
That's too bad.
Today is the Harvest Festival.{LF}It's a time to give thanks. I guess {LF}even humans can come up with a good{LF}idea every now and then.
That's quite a compliment {LF}coming from you, Jake.
Quiet, human.{LF}I'm not complimenting you humans.{LF}I'm just complimenting the festival.
(I don't see the difference...)
Today is the Harvest Festival.{LF}It's a time to give thanks. I guess {LF}even humans can come up {LF}with a good idea every now and then.
It's the Monster Contest.{LF}Do you really want to show off{LF}your monsters that badly?
Don't think you won by{LF}your own strength.
Ha ha! That wasn't exactly{LF}the best I've ever seen, human.
It's the Monster Contest.{LF}Showing off your monsters {LF}doesn't prove anything.
Oh, did your monster rate well?
Instead of relying on your monsters,{LF}you should try using your own strength{LF}sometime.
It's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I wonder if Ceci is going.
It's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}You kids should be in bed before{LF}the stars start falling, though.
Today is the Mining Contest. You'll{LF}have to go into the caves to mine.{LF}I'm safe as long as I have my sword,{LF}but it might be dangerous for you.
If you let your guard down,{LF}it could be dangerous for you too, Jake.
Human, I don't need you to tell me that.
I never thought you'd be able to...
Hmph. you've got a lot to learn, human.
Today is the Mining Contest. You'll{LF}have to go into the caves to mine.{LF}I'm safe as long as I have my sword,{LF}but it might be dangerous for you.
I never thought that you'd win,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Hmph. you've got a lot to learn,{LF}little human.
Today is New Year's Eve.{LF}It's been quite the year.
Try not to cause too much {LF}trouble next year.
Today is New Year's Eve.{LF}It's been quite the year.
What is it, little human?
I read your request on the{LF}bulletin board.
I read your request on the{LF}bulletin board.
Oh, you did? Let me fill you in{LF}on the job.
I need more materials to{LF}continue work on my sword.{LF}I want you to go find a {LF}mineral to use in my work.
I want you to bring me one{LF}piece of ＠アイテム９＠.
I can't do anything without{LF}the proper materials.{LF}Don't let me down, little human.
Bring me one piece of ＠アイテム９＠.
I can't do anything without{LF}the proper materials.
Did you read the bulletin board,{LF}little human? I have a job for you.
Bring me a ＠アイテム９＠.
I need it to make a piece of armor.
I asked Orland to do it, but he says{LF}it's too much of a hassle.
So, I want you to go instead.
You can sometimes find a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}when you defeat a ＠モンスター９＠ on{LF}Blessia Island.
Good luck, little human.
Bring me a ＠アイテム９＠.
You can sometimes find a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}when you defeat a ＠モンスター９＠ on{LF}Blessia Island.
What is it, little human?
I read your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
I read your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
Ah...
So, I'm not saying he was anything{LF}special, but your father was a fairly{LF}decent warrior.
I was thinking that since{LF}you've got his blood running{LF}through your veins, you must{LF}have some potential.
But I wonder just how good of a {LF}warrior can you become.
So, I'm giving you a special {LF}weapon I made just for you.{LF}Think of it as a helping hand.
If you want to surpass the skill of{LF}your father, you must master this{LF}weapon.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Don't disappoint me, little human.
You're carrying too much right now.{LF}Make some room in your backpack, {LF}little human.
If you want to surpass the skill of{LF}your father, you must master this{LF}weapon.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Don't disappoint me, little human.
You've done well, little human.{LF}Thank you.
You might have the potential{LF}to be a half-decent warrior.
Whether or not you can surpass{LF}your father will be up to you.
I'm glad you've been able to make{LF}yourself useful, human.
I think you still have much to learn,{LF}human.
Don't let it get to your head, human.
Jake, I'm going around town making{LF}sure there aren't any problems.{LF}Is everything fine here?
Problems? No, there's nothing wrong{LF}here, human.
Oh, that's good.
What do you want, human?{LF}You're bothering me.
I'm here about your{LF}request on the bulletin board.
Is that it?{LF}Why didn't you say so, human?
...
Ceci seems to have lost something,{LF}and is quite upset over it.{LF}I want you to help her for me, human.
That's all.{LF}Now get on with it.
Do it for Ceci, human.
Um... What am I looking for?
Why don't you ask her?
Yes, of course...
Have you found what Ceci has been{LF}looking for? Hurry up and start{LF}looking for it, human.{LF}Don't just stand around here.
I found what Ceci had lost.
Oh, you did?
You should be proud.{LF}You were able to help Ceci.
All right, I guess you{LF}earned this reward.
I don't really want to give you{LF}anything, but since it was for Ceci,{LF}I'll make a special exception.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You can use this to clear out unwanted {LF}weeds or to cut down feed for your{LF}monsters. It should come in handy.
Try not to just swing it around wildly.{LF}You might accidentally chop {LF}down your own crops.
I know that sounds like {LF}something you might do, human.
And that's that.{LF}On your way, human.
You're carrying too much right now.{LF}Make some room in your backpack,{LF}little human.
You've got guts to come {LF}talk to me, human.
I'm here about your{LF}request on the bulletin board...
What, you can't come talk to me{LF}unless you've got some agenda?{LF}Just like a human.
Ha ha ha...{LF}No, that's not it at all...
Anyway, what do you need?
I thought I'd give you{LF}a chance to prove yourself.
A chance to prove myself?
That's what I just said, isn't it?{LF}Now keep your mouth shut and listen.
I left a {LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}somewhere in Trieste Forest.
Find it, and bring it back to me.{LF}It's a test to see if you're really{LF}as weak as you look.
You went all the way there {LF}to leave that just as a test?
Yes. Do you have a problem with that?
No, I guess not...
Good. Hurry up, then.{LF}If you don't bring it back,{LF}that means you're spineless after all.
Ha ha ha...{LF}I'll bring it back.
You don't have it yet?{LF}What's taking you so long, human?
Hurry to Trieste Forest{LF}and bring me back a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Understand, human?
If you don't bring it back,{LF}that means you're spineless after all.
I'm here about your{LF}request on the bulletin board.
What are you doing here, human?
What?!
Why aren't you at Blessia Island?
Um... What am I supposed {LF}to be doing there?
You're brining me back a {LF}＠アイテム９＠,{LF}of course!
Since you're so spineless, {LF}I thought I'd give you a {LF}chance to prove yourself.{LF}You should be thankful, human.
Yeah...
...
Well, what are you waiting for, human?{LF}Bring me back a {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Get on over to Blessia Island{LF}and bring me back a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Understand, human?
Get on with it.
What are you doing here?
Um,{LF}I saw your request {LF}on the bulletin board.
I see.{LF}So you've come to let{LF}me beat you around a bit.
What?!
I'm going to give you a{LF}chance to fight me,{LF}one on one.
You've gotten a little {LF}too confident lately, human.{LF}It's time to show you{LF}what true power looks like.
Overconfident? Who? Me?
Enough talk, human.{LF}This won't be settled by words.
Are you ready, human?
W-Wait!
Don't shame yourself even further{LF}by trying to run away, human.{LF}Let's do this.
I-I guess. If there's no other choice.
There isn't. It's time to fight.
A-All right! I'm ready!
Oh, Jake, what are you doing out here?
And you're with ＠カイル＠＠, too.
Hello, Cecilia.
What are you two doing?
Ceci,{LF}＠カイル＠＠ and I are{LF}in the middle of having a duel.
Please stay out of it.
A duel? Forget about that nonsense{LF}and come give Egan a hand.
He's been looking for you, Jake.
Oh... He has?{LF}Well... If you say so, Ceci,{LF}I'd better go help.
Hey, human.{LF}We'll have to postpone the duel.{LF}I'll let you go for now.
You should thank Ceci{LF}for saving your life.
I'm sorry that Jake is giving{LF}you so much trouble, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
No...don't worry about it.
Well, we'd better get going.
Jake, let's go.{LF}Egan is waiting on us.
Hmph.
(They left...)
(She's really got him{LF}in the palm of her hand...)
(Well, at least I didn't{LF}have to fight him.)
What do you want, human?
Um... I think we should talk.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Well, um, are you sure? We can talk{LF}about whatever you're interested{LF}in...
Listen. You've been spending a lot{LF}of time with Ceci lately, haven't you?
I'm only going to say this once.{LF}You'd better keep your hands off her,{LF}human. She's not for you!
Jake, do you like Cecilia?
Wh-What does that matter, human?
Ceci is a half-elf, just like I am.{LF}She doesn't belong with {LF}one of your kind.
What are you talking about?{LF}There are plenty of elves {LF}that have married humans.
A marriage between {LF}an elf and a human?{LF}I can't accept that.
So you're saying that you {LF}can't accept Cecilia, either?{LF}I mean, she's the daughter of a{LF}human and an elf...
And so are you, for that matter!{LF}Are you saying you don't even accept{LF}the marriage of your own parents?
...
J-Just...keep away from Ceci!{LF}Or else!
O-Okay.
Stay away from Ceci.{LF}Got it, human?
When it starts to warm up in the spring,{LF}I get so tired...
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival.{LF}Humans are always looking to make up{LF}some reason to make a big fuss.
You get drunk all afternoon and make{LF}all that noise. Fools, all of you.
We had an earthquake.{LF}I'm fine, and I heard Ceci is, too.
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest.{LF}Only you humans could have thought{LF}up such a pointless competition.
It's almost the time of year to {LF}start swimming in the sea again.{LF}It's gotten so hot out that even{LF}swimming doesn't sound half bad.
Just make sure not to drown{LF}yourself out there, human.
Tomorrow is the {LF}Monster Taming Contest.
Monsters aren't just for fighting.
You're saying that we can {LF}make friends with them too, right?
I don't think that's {LF}something a human can do.
We had another earthquake.{LF}We just had one of those {LF}not too long ago. What's going on?
Bah. Summer...{LF}I'm already tired of hearing humans{LF}complain about how hot it is.
It is pretty hot out, though...
Uh, Jake, it sounds a lot like you're{LF}complaining about the heat too.
What did you say, human?{LF}Don't group me with you lot.{LF}I'm not complaining at all.
Heh. Uhh...if you say so.
Tomorrow is the Dance Festival.{LF}Have you decided who you{LF}are going to ask out?{LF}Not Ceci, right, human?{LF}
Tomorrow is the Fishing Contest.{LF}What a boring idea for a contest.
Tomorrow is the Adventure Contest.{LF}Hah! It'll be a piece of cake.
You sound like you're pretty{LF}confident, Jake.
Yeah, you couldn't possibly{LF}be a match for me.{LF}Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠, but I'm not{LF}going to lose to a human.
Another earthquake...{LF}There's been too many of {LF}those recently.
I wonder what is going on.
Yeah, me too.
I didn't ask you, human.
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival.{LF}This year has been bountiful, and{LF}we need to thank the earth for its{LF}blessings.
It's started to get cooler outside.{LF}It makes me feel like refocusing{LF}all of my efforts into my training.
Don't push yourself too hard.{LF}Be careful not to hurt yourself.
You think I'd be dumb enough to do that?{LF}Listen, human, I don't have time {LF}to talk to you now. I need to get {LF}back to my practicing.
Tomorrow is the Monster Contest.{LF}I wish I could fight one of the strong {LF}monsters, just to see how far {LF}I've come with my training.
I bet you'd be able to handle{LF}a high-level monster, Jake.
Of course I could. It wouldn't even{LF}be a close fight.
I hope it's sunny tomorrow.{LF}Who are you going to ask out {LF}to the Shooting Star Festival?{LF}It better not be Ceci.
It looks like this is going to {LF}be another cold winter.{LF}I don't care for the cold much.{LF}My sword arm gets stiff in the cold.
Hah, so even you have {LF}a weakness, Jake!
I still wouldn't lose to any human.{LF}Ha ha ha!
Tomorrow is the Mining Contest.{LF}You need a hammer to mine, {LF}not a sword.{LF}I'd better not mix it up...
A hammer swings a lot differently{LF}than a sword, doesn't it?
Well, if I was against a human {LF}opponent, it might make {LF}a good handicap for me.
Hmm...another earthquake.{LF}I wonder what's behind{LF}all of these earthquakes.
＠カイル＠＠, you should investigate it.{LF}My intuition is always right, human.
It's the end of another year.{LF}Don't cause any trouble next year,{LF}human.
Ha ha ha, the same to you, Jake.
I don't want to hear it, human.
When it starts to warm up in the spring,{LF}I can get so tired...
It's so hot out every day.{LF}Doesn't it bother you?
The autumn leaves are pretty,{LF}aren't they?
The cold winter air helps{LF}me concentrate.
...{LF}What are you looking at, human?
You make me sick, human...
...{LF}Get out of here, human.
You're in the way, human.
Go find something better to do, human.
Out of the way, human.
Your face is the last thing{LF}I want to see in the morning.
I don't want to talk to you humans.
Stay away from me, human.
You must not have any friends, human.
Stop wasting your time{LF}around here, human.
Go home, human.
This country is called{LF}the Kingdom of Norad.
It's not a very large country,{LF}but it's prosperous and peaceful.
But just because it's peaceful{LF}doesn't mean I can stop training.
Alvarna is a fairly backwater town,{LF}even for Norad.
Even so, if I catch you making fun {LF}of it, I'm not going to let you off {LF}easily.
No...{LF}I wouldn't ever...
Hmm... Wouldn't you?
Norad is supposedly{LF}where you humans first came from.
Us elves don't really care either way,{LF}of course.
I find that fascinating.{LF}I'd like to know more.
I don't know any more than that,{LF}and I don't care either.{LF}Find it out for yourself, human.
Why do you have so much energy in the{LF}morning, human? What is it that's{LF}so important for you to do?
I think it's a good thing{LF}to have energy in the morning.{LF}Do you not like mornings, Jake?
Listen, human,{LF}the only thing I don't like about{LF}mornings is having to see you {LF}humans so early in my day.
You look happy, human.{LF}Did something good happen to you?
N-No.{LF}I don't think so.
Not that I care if anything{LF}good happens to you or not, human.
Hey, human.{LF}Have you been staying out late?{LF}What are you working so hard for?
That ＠アイテム８＠{LF}will be useful to practice on.{LF}Feel free to bring me as many {LF}as you want.
That ＠アイテム８＠{LF}will be useful to practice on.{LF}Feel free to bring me as many {LF}as you want.
That ＠アイテム８＠{LF}will be useful to practice on.{LF}Feel free to bring me as many {LF}as you want.
You don't seem very{LF}interested in style, human. {LF}Maybe you should pay more{LF}attention to how you look.
Do you worry about {LF}how you look, Jake?
Of course I do, human.{LF}I care about my appearance, {LF}unlike you.
Look at the hilt on my sword.{LF}Isn't it stylish?{LF}Well, human?
Oh, you're talking about weapons...
Hello, human.{LF}Do you pay attention to{LF}the way you dress?
Because I'm a warrior,{LF}I only wear clothes that have{LF}a good freedom of movement.
If I wore too much,{LF}I wouldn't be able to move {LF}around as quickly.
But even so, {LF}I'd still be able to beat you, {LF}human.
Hey, human.{LF}You're wearing strange clothes.
Oh, I am?
Yeah, you're really a mess, human.
Have you heard the rumor about the {LF}ghost that comes out in the {LF}clinic at night?
To tell the truth, {LF}I made up the whole story.{LF}I was just having a little fun.{LF}Ha ha.
If Natalie finds out, {LF}won't she be mad?
Don't you dare say a word, human.{LF}If you tell her, {LF}I won't let you off easily.{LF}You'd better not forget it, human.
Have you heard the rumor about the {LF}ghost that comes out in the {LF}clinic at night?
To tell the truth, {LF}I made up the whole story.{LF}I was just having a little fun.{LF}Ha ha.
If Natalie finds out, {LF}won't she be mad?
Don't you dare say a word, human.{LF}If you tell her, {LF}I won't let you off easily. Go ahead,{LF}try it, if you don't believe me.{LF}

If Natalie finds out, {LF}won't she be mad?
Don't you dare say a word, human.{LF}If you tell her, I won't let you off{LF}easily. Natalie herself won't be able {LF}to fix you up when I'm done with you.
I hate milk.{LF}Don't even think about {LF}bringing me any.
I hate milk.{LF}Don't even think about {LF}bringing me any.
I hate milk.{LF}Don't even think about {LF}bringing me any.
You seem like the kind of guy that{LF}would forget his own birthday.
If you don't know your birthday,{LF}how can you know how old you are?{LF}That sounds tough.
It is.{LF}I'm trying my best to remember it,{LF}but...
I don't really care{LF}about humans' birthdays.
But since we're talking about it,{LF}I'll tell you my birthday.
It's the 23rd of Summer.{LF}Don't you forget it.
You still can't remember{LF}your own birthday, can you?{LF}Mine's the 23rd of Summer, {LF}by the way.
Not that I expect a human to{LF}care about my birthday.
You still can't remember{LF}your own birthday, can you?{LF}Mine's the 23rd of Summer, {LF}by the way.
Not that I expect a human to{LF}care about my birthday.
Hey, human.{LF}You've been here a while now.{LF}What do you think of me?
I think you're a good person.
Well, I don't know...
Ha ha! Don't say such an obvious lie{LF}right to my face. That's what I hate{LF}about you humans.
Just so you know,{LF}I absolutely loathe you.
Hey, human.{LF}You've been here a while now.{LF}What do you think of me?
I think you're a good person.
Well, I don't know...
Ha ha, give me a break.{LF}You're not going to win me{LF}over with flattery, human.
You're annoying.{LF}Leave me alone, human.
Hey, human.{LF}You've been here a while now.{LF}What do you think of me?
I think you're a good person.
Well, I don't know...
Ha ha, you've got to be kidding.{LF}I don't care if you like me or not.
I don't care about you, either, human.
Hey, human.{LF}You know how I don't like you humans.{LF}They're all worthless.
That's not true.{LF}I think that there are plenty{LF}of good people out there.
Hmm... And I'm sure you think {LF}you're one of those "good people."{LF}Right, human?
Hey, human.{LF}You know how I don't like you humans.
I'm sure there are some decent ones,{LF}but in general, I don't care for humans{LF}at all.
I think that there are plenty{LF}of good people out there.
Yeah, well I won't hold my breath.
Hey, human.{LF}You know how I don't like you humans.{LF}I don't begin to understand{LF}what you all are thinking.
Really?{LF}I don't think we're that {LF}different from elves.
Don't group us together, human.{LF}It's insulting.
You say you've lost your memory?{LF}It sounds suspicious to me.
I'm not making it up.
Sure, you say that, human,{LF}but why should I believe you?
You say you've lost your memory?{LF}It sounds suspicious to me.
I'm not making it up.
Is it that easy to lose{LF}your own memories?
You say you've lost your memory?{LF}That sounds made up to me.
I'm sorry to say that it's true...
Not that I care either way, human.
If you've really lost your memory,{LF}shouldn't you be doing something{LF}about it, instead of lazing away{LF}on a simple farm all day?
If you've really lost your memory,{LF}shouldn't you be doing something{LF}about it, instead of working on{LF}a simple farm all day?
Shouldn't you take this {LF}a little more seriously?
If you've really lost your memory,{LF}shouldn't you be doing something{LF}about it, instead of working on{LF}a simple farm all day?
Shouldn't you take this {LF}a little more seriously?
Do you have any plans for the future,{LF}human?
I don't know yet.{LF}I thought I was fine {LF}just working in my field.
I guess I shouldn't expect any more{LF}from you. I'm working to become a{LF}blacksmith, myself. I think the work{LF}would suit the life of a warrior.
Do you want to become anything{LF}in the future, human?
I don't really know yet.{LF}I thought I was fine {LF}just working in my field.
Ha ha! Just like a human would think.{LF}I'm working to become a blacksmith.{LF}I think it suits the life of a warrior.
Do you want to become anything{LF}in the future, human?
I haven't completely made up my mind.{LF}I'm fine just working in my field for{LF}now.
Ha ha! You humans are simple {LF}creatures, aren't you? I'm working {LF}to become a blacksmith. I'll even {LF}let you buy some of my weapons.
Ceci likes to wander off alone {LF}sometimes. When she goes away,{LF}I can't help but worry about her.
Ceci likes to wander off alone {LF}sometimes. When she goes away,{LF}I can't help but worry about her.
Ceci likes to wander off alone{LF}sometimes. If you notice her {LF}going somewhere before I do, {LF}you'd better let me know, human.
Father always looks kind,{LF}but he can be scary when he's angry.
Really? I would never have guessed.{LF}He's always smiling so happily.
I don't think I'd mind it at all{LF}if you got mad with me.{LF}Ha ha.
I went to the cliffs and gathered {LF}lots of pretty flowers to give to Ceci.
I thought she would be happy to get{LF}them, but instead she was furious.{LF}She told me I needed to care {LF}more about the flowers.
I thought she'd like getting flowers.{LF}But I guess flowers are alive too.
I did something wrong to Ceci.
Has anything bad {LF}happened to you lately?
When I'm upset about something, {LF}I practice swinging my sword {LF}until I feel better. What do you do?{LF}Do you go work on your field?
Yes, actually, I do. {LF}Working outside on my field{LF}can help me clear my mind.
Yeah, you're as strange as I thought.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you ever thought {LF}about getting married?
Huh? That's actually a friendly,{LF}personal question.{LF}Are you feeling okay, Jake?
I just thought...that you might{LF}be happier with a wife.{LF}You know what? Never mind.{LF}Forget I said anything.
Do you like being married, human?{LF}I bet you're the kind of guy that{LF}does nothing but cause trouble for{LF}his wife.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
What?{LF}I'm surprised that you're asking me{LF}something like that all of a sudden,{LF}Jake.
Yeah, but you're getting to the age to{LF}start thinking about it. I'm starting{LF}to think about it a bit, myself.
Do you like being married, human?{LF}Don't take it for granted.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
What?{LF}I'm surprised that you're asking me{LF}something like that all of a sudden,{LF}Jake.
I was just wondering what{LF}kind of woman you'd like.
Do you like being married, human?{LF}Don't take it for granted{LF}or you might regret it.
My sword once broke while{LF}I was fighting a monster.
That monster was so strong that{LF}I had no choice but to run away.{LF}I can't believe it...
So that kind of thing {LF}happens even to you, Jake.
I just got unlucky, that's all.{LF}Normally, I'd never lose a fight.
Did you know?{LF}Ceci's cooking is delicious.
I'd love to try eating some of it.
Don't tell anyone, but{LF}I'd probably eat so much that{LF}I couldn't walk home.{LF}
Did you know?{LF}Ceci can make some delicious food.
I'd love to try eating some of it.
I'd probably eat so much that{LF}I couldn't walk home.{LF}That just means I need to train more.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
No, I don't.
Yeah, I've heard about it.
Monsters all come from a place {LF}called the Forest of Beginnings.{LF}I wonder what kind of a place it is...
Oh, you have?{LF}Never mind then.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
No, I don't.
Yeah, I've heard about it.
Every monster you defeat is sent {LF}back to the Forest of Beginnings.{LF}I don't know how it works, {LF}but it's true.
Oh, you have?{LF}Forget it, then.
Do you know about {LF}the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
No, I don't.
Yeah, I've heard about it.
Monsters all come from a place called{LF}the Forest of Beginnings. I'm sure {LF}that’s where I'd be able to find all{LF}sorts of strong monsters.
That would be a great place to go train.
Oh, you have?{LF}Forget it, then.
Are you satisfied with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I wish there were stronger opponents{LF}to practice against. I'm sure if I{LF}went to the capital, there would{LF}be plenty of tough warriors around.
But I have to admit, {LF}it's very pleasant here.
Are you satisfied with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I wish there were stronger opponents{LF}to practice against. I'm sure if I{LF}went to the capital, there would{LF}be plenty of tough warriors around.
I guess it would be something like{LF}you wanting to go to a place with{LF}larger fields.
Are you satisfied with this town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I wish there were stronger opponents{LF}to practice against. I'm sure if I{LF}went to the capital, there would{LF}be plenty of tough warriors around.
I bet there would be so many{LF}kinds of weapons to try out.{LF}I hope I can go there at least once.
Can't you feel the power that {LF}lies within the earth, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I can feel it. A large power. A power {LF}that even my sword couldn't compare to.
Don't you think that everything we have,{LF}all that we use to live and survive,{LF}we borrow from the earth?
Yeah.{LF}I don't think we'd be able to live {LF}without the power of the earth.
Can't you feel the power that lies {LF}within the earth, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I can feel it. A large power.{LF}We couldn't survive without it.
Yeah. I agree with you there.
I don't like you humans because you{LF}spread across the land, thinking{LF}little of nature. But I guess you're{LF}a little different from the rest.
Can't you feel the power that lies {LF}within the earth, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I can feel it. A large power.{LF}We couldn't survive without it.
Yeah. I agree with you there.
I don't like you humans because{LF}you spread across the land, thinking{LF}little of anything else.{LF}Look at the Sechs Empire.
But I guess that you're a little{LF}different from the rest,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Have you heard about {LF}the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
As a child, I'd listen to the legends {LF}of the Elder Dragon, and would get so{LF}scared that I wouldn't be able to go to{LF}sleep without a night light.
Even knowing full well they were {LF}all just stories and legends.{LF}They were that scary.
Have you heard about {LF}the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
They're legendary dragons that are{LF}so powerful that even my sword wouldn't{LF}make a single scratch on one.
Have you heard about {LF}the Elder Dragons,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I bet that their teeth and claws could{LF}be forged into an awesome weapon.{LF}I'd love to hold a weapon like that{LF}just once in my lifetime.
You're not bad for a human,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I think I've changed the way {LF}I view humans a little bit.
I never thought I'd hear{LF}you say that, Jake.{LF}What happened?
Nothing in particular.{LF}I guess I've just realized that{LF}humans have their good sides, too.
You're not bad for a human,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I think I've changed the way {LF}I view humans a little bit.
I never thought I'd hear{LF}you say that, Jake.{LF}What happened?
Nothing in particular.{LF}You're a strange one, aren't you?
You're not bad for a human,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I think I've changed the way {LF}I view humans a little bit.
I never thought I'd hear{LF}you say that, Jake.{LF}What happened?
Nothing in particular.{LF}You all are still humans, after all.
School? What's the point? You{LF}can't learn how to be a warrior in{LF}a classroom.
Make friends with Orland, little human.
There is a strong monster that lives{LF}deep in the middle of the forest. {LF}I think it would be a tough battle,{LF}even for me.
Children should learn through{LF}experience, not by coddling them.
Your father was a decent warrior,{LF}for a human.{LF}I wonder how you'll turn out.
What is it, little human?
What is it, little human?{LF}Are you here to see Orland?
What is it, little human?
What is it, little human?
Why are you here?
Why are you here, little human?
Go outside and play if you don't have{LF}anything better to do with yourself.
Are you here to see Orland?
Are you looking for a sword?
Are you looking for a weapon?
If you're looking for a weapon{LF}for a human child to use,{LF}go ask Tanya.
If you're looking for a sword,{LF}you've got the money to pay for it,{LF}right?
I've worked up a good sweat today.
I've worked up a good sweat today.
I've worked up a good sweat today.
I've worked up a good sweat today.
Did you come to buy{LF}a sword or something?
Is the one you already have{LF}not good enough for you anymore?
If you're looking for a good sword,{LF}I've got one for you, human.
Are you looking for a sword? You've{LF}got the money to pay for it, right?
You're bothering me.
Don't bother me.
I don't have time for this, human.
If you need something to do, you're{LF}looking in the wrong place, human.
What a nice breeze...
What a nice breeze...{LF}The wind spirit must be in good form...
What a pleasant breeze...{LF}It helps me focus my senses...
What a pleasant cold breeze...{LF}It helps me clear my mind...
Don't forget to equip yourself{LF}before going into a dungeon, human.
This area is like{LF}a gateway into the town.
What are you doing in a place like this?{LF}Do you have some kind of errand inside{LF}the dungeon?
You'll be risking your life{LF}if you go any further.
It's good to have an adventure,{LF}but don't overdo it.
You should stay away from {LF}the dungeons. If you're not strong {LF}enough to go in, you're just {LF}asking for trouble.
I could be mistaken,{LF}but you look like you've changed.
You don't have the face of a child{LF}who just works on the farm all day...{LF}Have you been up to something?
You look stronger.{LF}What have you been doing?
Your father came back. I'm happy for{LF}you, little human.
What do you want, human?
What do you want, little human?
Do you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}take Orland to be your husband,{LF}to have and to hold,{LF}from this day forward...
...For better, for worse, for richer,{LF}for poorer, in sickness and in health,{LF}to love and to cherish, till death{LF}do you part?
Um...
Um...
Ba ha ha ha! You're getting{LF}embarrassed, ＠アルス＠＠!
Come on, ＠アルス＠＠, we're{LF}trying to play wedding here!{LF}
Oh, we're just playing?
Of course we're just playing.{LF}We're still only kids, you know.{LF}We can't get married yet.
Oh, I thought you were getting{LF}carried away, Orland!
Anyway, we have to do this{LF}properly, like a real wedding!{LF}Even if it's just pretend, we{LF}have to make it accurate!
You had me surprised there.{LF}Ha ha ha.
Oh...
Oh, you kids crack me up!{LF}Ba ha ha!
Well, do you take Orland as{LF}your husband or not,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Hey, both of you...
Yes! I promise to love him!
Great! Now it's your turn,{LF}Orland!
Do you promise to love her{LF}until death do you part?
...I do.
There, it's official now!{LF}Ba ha ha ha!
It's just a game, of course.
Hey, both of you...
Of course!
Well, that was fun.{LF}Talk to you later, ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, you got it for me, did you?
You really like bugs, huh?
You really like bugs, huh?
Something wrong with that?
Um, no, not at all!
Um, no, not at all!
Thanks. Take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
See you later.
You're carrying too much stuff.{LF}Get rid of something.
You're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
You're giving this to me?{LF}Thank you.
What's this for?
This is a thank you from Leonel{LF}for helping him at school.
This is a thank you from Leonel{LF}for helping him at school.
Oh, is it?
That's all? Aren't you happy?
That's all? Aren't you happy?
Don't worry. I'll keep it.
You don't need to be so curt.{LF}But why did he want to give you{LF}that ＠アイテム９＠?
You don't need to be so curt.{LF}But why did he want to give you{LF}that ＠アイテム９＠?
These things seem to be all{LF}the rage these days.
Roy and Leonel are both collecting{LF}them right now. I'm not interested{LF}in them myself, though.
I see...
I see...
Well, tell Leonel that I got his{LF}present.
Me neither.{LF}It doesn't sound bad, though.
All right! See you later, Orland.
Bye.
That's kind of you.{LF}I like a nice{LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}Thanks.
Can I have this?{LF}Thank you.
Can I have this?{LF}Thank you.
I don't need this.{LF}Actually, I hate it.
Here, try this.
Here, try this.
What is it?{LF}Should I drink it?
Well, I guess talking {LF}with you isn't that bad.
You're giving this to me?{LF}Thanks, I'm glad to take it from you.
Here, try this.
Here, try this.
What is it?{LF}Should I drink it?
...{LF}What is it? Don't look at me like that.
Thanks. It's nice of you to give me{LF}that. I'd be even happier to get it{LF}on my birthday.
Thanks. It's nice of you to give me{LF}that. I'd be even happier to get it{LF}on my birthday.
This is a great birthday present.{LF}Thank you.
This is a great birthday present.{LF}Thank you.
I don't need any more.{LF}One's enough for me.
I don't need any more.{LF}One's enough for me.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
You're giving this to me?{LF}Thanks, I'll be happy {LF}to take it from you.
I hate spring.{LF}I get so tired in the springtime.
Don't get in my way.{LF}I'm trying to study here.
School isn't for playing,{LF}but Roy plays all day anyway.
Keep quiet.{LF}I'm trying to focus {LF}on my studies here.
It's the end of another week.
It's the beginning of another week.{LF}I wonder what I'll learn next?
If you fall asleep in class,{LF}you'll fall behind.
I want to learn so much more.
Mana's class is easy to understand.
It's hard to study when{LF}it's so hot outside.
Roy's always in a bad mood {LF}on Mondays.
It's going to be hard to grow crops in{LF}your field. I think you'd be better off{LF}just working to gather materials for{LF}now.
Why did Barrett become a teacher?
I wish there were other{LF}elves in this school.
My father says that elves{LF}are smarter than humans.
There aren't many kids in class,{LF}but I like it that way.
I'm mad at Roy and Cammy.{LF}They threw snowballs at me{LF}on the way to class.
But I'm not going to do it back to them.{LF}I don't have time to act so childish.
Sometimes I have trouble telling{LF}Sera and Serena apart. {LF}But I guess it doesn't really{LF}matter to me which is which.
I let Roy borrow my eraser,{LF}but he told me that he lost it.{LF}What, does he think I'll give{LF}him another one? I'm not stupid.
Are you listening in class?{LF}Once I'm taught something, {LF}I never forget it.
The fountain here really stands out.{LF}After that, there's not much else.
Have you been reading {LF}the bulletin board?
Whenever I come here,{LF}Roy and Cammy always bug {LF}me to play with them.
I wonder if the fountain is{LF}ever going to run out of water?
Are you going to take a bath too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Are you going to take a bath too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Are you going to take a bath too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Are you going to take a bath too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
If you're asking to play,{LF}I'm busy.
Wouldn't you like to have a{LF}＠アイテム８＠?{LF}I know I would.
If you're asking to play,{LF}I'm busy.
If you're asking to play,{LF}I'm busy.
What do you want?{LF}Why did you come over here?
A ＠アイテム７＠{LF}just isn't something I'm interested in.{LF}It sounds so...common.
You want to play?{LF}I can't right now, I'm busy.
Why did you come to my home?{LF}Are you looking for something to do?
You came, ＠アルス＠＠.
Let's go watch the stars.
I hope we can see a falling star!
I guess.
What, you're not excited, Orland?
No, I like astronomy well enough.
There!  A shooting star!{LF}Ooooh... It was so pretty!
Yeah, it was pretty.{LF}Don't make a big deal about it.
What? Why not? Isn't it amazing?
I'd rather watch the stars silently.
Wow, that one was pretty, too!
Yeah.
...
Hey, Orland, do you really enjoy just{LF}watching the stars without talking at{LF}all?
No, not really. But I'd rather watch{LF}in silence than talk.
Oh... Well, I'm bored, Orland! Let's{LF}talk!
Well, you can talk, but I can't{LF}promise I'll answer.
Oh... You're mean, Orland!{LF}I invited you out here!
I know...{LF}Look, don't cry...
Heh heh! Okay, let's talk, then!
I guess I don't have a choice, do I?
There's another one!
There seem to be a lot on the night{LF}of the festival, huh?
Hey, Orland, why are you always so{LF}quiet? Do you just hate everyone or{LF}something?
No, I don't really care one way or{LF}the other. I just have a lot of{LF}things I'd rather do by myself.
Oh... But you should hang out with{LF}everyone once in a while! It'd be{LF}more fun if you were around!
Really? All right. I'll come next{LF}time.
Great! That should be lots of fun!
Maybe. Like I said, I usually like{LF}doing things alone.
I don’t know how you manage to hang{LF}out with everyone, go to school, and{LF}take care of your farm all at the{LF}same time. I'm impressed.
Heh heh! Are you?
Yes. But don't let it get to your{LF}head.
All right, let's go home.
What? Already?
Yeah. We got to see the shooting{LF}stars, right?
Besides, you look cold.
Aww... Are you worried about me?{LF}That's so sweet!
Sh-Shut up! I didn't mean it like{LF}that!
Anyway, goodnight, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}It was fun.
I had fun, too! Thank you, Orland!
Well, see you later.{LF}Don't catch a cold, now...
I won't! See you tomorrow, Orland!
...
......
Hello!
Hello!
Yes? Do you need something?
I know you humans like to talk{LF}endlessly, but I've got better{LF}things to do.
Hey, don't be like that.{LF}My name's ＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, don't be like that!{LF}My name's ＠アルス＠＠.
...
...I'm Orland. I'm Jake and{LF}Cecilia's son.
...I'm Orland. I'm Jake and{LF}Yue's son.
Nice to meet you, Orland.
Nice to meet you, Orland!
Morning.
Hello. Good afternoon.
Hello.
Happy New Year,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}The cherry blossoms are{LF}all over the town.
Yeah.
It's pretty, isn't it.{LF}By the way, Orland...
Let's go look at the flowers together.
Aren't you having fun?
We should go look{LF}at the flowers together.
Let's go look at{LF}the flowers together.{LF}All right?
Flower watching...{LF}Sure, let's go.
Let's go to {LF}＠マップ９＠.
You go on ahead.{LF}I'll meet you there.
Are you having fun?{LF}Is it fun to look at flowers?
Let's go look at the flowers together.
Yeah, I think it can be fun.
Really?{LF}I don't care much about it either way.
The cherry blossoms are pretty.
Go on ahead to {LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll meet you there.
That was fun, ＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}Aren't the cherry blossoms pretty?
Today's the Eating Contest.{LF}What a strange competition.
Nice work, ＠アルス＠＠.
That was silly.
Swimming season starts today,{LF}but I still prefer a walk in the{LF}mountains.
There's a Monster Taming Contest.{LF}My dad said it's easy for elves to make {LF}friends with monsters.
Maybe I'll take part.
I just got unlucky.{LF}How could I hope to win...?
You're skilled at befriending monsters,{LF}aren't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
If you weren't confident, then maybe{LF}you shouldn't have competed.
It's the Dance Festival tonight. I never{LF}see anyone dancing the rest of the time, {LF}and yet they'll all dance tonight! Why {LF}is that?
Do you want to dance with me?
You aren't dancing, Orland?
You want to dance with me? Sure!{LF}Get ready, then!
Sorry, I can't.
If I have a change of heart, I may join {LF}in later.
That was fun, ＠アルス＠＠.
Sorry I couldn't dance with you.
Everyone loves to dance, don't they?
It's the Dance Festival today.{LF}Do you like to dance, ＠アルス＠＠?
It's the Big Cook-Off today.{LF}Can you cook, ＠アルス＠＠?
Wow, you can cook! I'm quite impressed.
I can't help feeling that, if you don't{LF}like cooking, you probably shouldn't {LF}have bothered taking part...?
It's the Adventure Contest today.{LF}A real test of your mettle.
Well done, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I must admit, you've quite surprised me.
You wore yourself out for nothing, huh?
It's the Harvest Festival today. My dad{LF}always says to never forget to thank the {LF}Earth for its blessings.
It's the Monster Contest today. I don't{LF}have any monsters of my own, though.
Wow, you've got a real powerful monster{LF}there!
That...wasn't so impressive, was it?
It's the Shooting Star Festival tonight. {LF}Astronomy can be a lot of fun, you know.
Want to go to together?
That festival starts so late...
Watch the stars together? Yeah, okay.{LF}Sounds good.
Okay, ＠アルス＠＠. Let's meet at{LF}Falling Star Path at 9 PM tonight.
Sorry, I can't.{LF}Why don't you ask someone else?
I can stay up no problem.{LF}But I'm not so sure about you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Okay, ＠アルス＠＠. Let's meet at{LF}Falling Star Path at 9 PM tonight.
Sorry, I can't.{LF}Why don't you ask someone else?
What beautiful shooting stars.{LF}I had fun!
It has to be night before we can see{LF}shooting stars, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}That goes without saying.
It's the Shooting Star Festival tonight. {LF}Where do you think shooting stars come {LF}from?
It's the Mining Contest today. It can{LF}be fun, sometimes, if you find something {LF}rare.
Hah hah! Victory was no problem for me!{LF}I didn't even really have to try that {LF}hard.
I didn't think you could do it,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, to be honest.
That was a shame.
The end of another year.{LF}Time really flies, doesn't it!
Yes? Do you need something?
I saw your posting on {LF}the bulletin board.
Um, I saw your posting on {LF}the bulletin board...
Ah, of course, the board. Well{LF}then, to business. This bag of{LF}＠アイテム９＠ is for you.
Roy gave it to me, but I don't need{LF}it. Here, take it.
But...this was a gift from Roy, right?{LF}Are you sure you should just give it {LF}away?
But...this was a gift from Roy, right?{LF}Are you sure you should just give it {LF}away?
Do you want it or not?
I'll take it.
I can't take it...
Roy gave it to you... I can't just take it.
Roy gave it to you... I can't just take it.
You don't want it? I'll just toss{LF}it, then. You sure you don't want{LF}it.?
What? You're just going to throw it{LF}away?
What? You're just going to throw it{LF}away?
Don't throw it away. I'll take it.
I can't take it...
Fine. You don't want it.{LF}That's that, then.
See you later, ＠アルス＠＠.
Okay, I'll take it.
Okay, I'll take it.
Great. Here you go, then.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Do whatever you want with it.{LF}See you later.
If you're really just going to throw it{LF}away, I'll take it.
If you're really just going to throw it{LF}away, I'll take it.
No need to lose your temper. You{LF}should have just taken it to begin{LF}with. Here.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Do whatever you want with it.{LF}See you later.
Make some space in your backpack{LF}so I can give it to you.
What? You want something?
Yeah. I'm here about your message on{LF}the bulletin board.
Yeah. I'm here about your message on{LF}the bulletin board.
Great. Can you take this to Barrett?
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
He asked me to bring it to him.{LF}Make sure you deliver it, okay?
Give the ＠アイテム９＠ to Barrett.{LF}Let me know when you've done it.
You delivered it? Great.
Barrett told me to tell you to bring it{LF}yourself next time.
Barrett told me to tell you to bring it {LF}yourself next time.
Hmph. I don't have time for that.
Anyway, here's something for your{LF}trouble.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
See you later.
You're carrying too much stuff.{LF}Get rid of some of it.
You want something?
I'm here about your bulletin board {LF}posting. What do you need?
I'm here about your bulletin board {LF}posting. What do you need?
Great. Listen up, then. You may be{LF}surprised to learn that I'm a bit{LF}of an insect buff.
I want an ＠アイテム９＠ for my{LF}collection. Can you get me one?
Wow, you like insects, Orland?{LF}I would never have guessed.
Wow, you like insects, Orland?{LF}I would never have guessed!
So what if I do? And don't tell Roy,{LF}either! He can be so annoying.
Okay, I'll keep it secret. Don't worry,{LF}I'll get you an ＠アイテム９＠.
Okay, I'll keep it secret. Don't worry,{LF}I'll get you an ＠アイテム９＠.
You can get an ＠アイテム９＠{LF}from a ＠モンスター９＠.
All right, I'm counting on you.
Get me an ＠アイテム９＠.
You can get an ＠アイテム９＠{LF}from a ＠モンスター９＠.
I'm counting on you.
What's up? You want something?
I'm here about your bulletin board {LF}posting. What do you need?
I'm here about your bulletin board {LF}posting. What do you need?
I've got something on my mind, actually. {LF}I'm not all that happy with our lessons {LF}at the moment.
How do you feel, ＠アルス＠＠?
I dunno, I think things are fine the{LF}way they are...
Not me. I want harder classes.{LF}The ones we're taking now aren't{LF}cutting it.
Wow, you must be pretty gifted if{LF}you think our current classes are{LF}too easy!
Not really. Everyone else is just{LF}happy to settle for mediocrity.
You think...? I don't really feel{LF}that's true...
Well, whatever. In any case, I want{LF}you to go and tell Barrett to teach{LF}us harder lessons.
Can't you tell him yourself?
No, I'm very busy. Unlike you.
Let me know when you've talked to{LF}him.
Go and tell Barrett to teach{LF}us harder lessons.
The lessons we have now are too{LF}easy.
Good news! I talked to Barrett. He{LF}said he'd prepare special lessons{LF}just for you, Orland!
Really? That's good. Now I can learn {LF}lots of new stuff.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
No problem.
Barrett said he was impressed{LF}at how fast you wanted to learn,{LF}Orland.
I am, too.
I don't need your praise...
Hey... Are you blushing?!
No!
Ah... Okay, sorry...
Anyway, he also said...that you{LF}need to start getting along better{LF}with other people.
Hmph. I don't have time for that.{LF}Other people just hold me back.
Barrett wouldn't be happy if he{LF}heard you talking like that...
Yeah, I know, I know...
Anyway... Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
No problem!
Here's something for your trouble.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I saw the bulletin board, Orland.{LF}What do you want to talk about?
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠. Yes, I did want to talk{LF}with you.
Tell me... Do you like talking with me?{LF}I mean, don't you have more fun talking{LF}with other people?
Well, of course I have fun talking with{LF}other people, but I especially like{LF}talking to you!
Anyway, I have a question for you,{LF}Orland... Why don't you like talking{LF}to other people?
Talking to other people is a waste of{LF}time, that's why. I'd rather use that{LF}time for study than idle chatter.
Taking the time to talk to you is a{LF}exception to that rule.
Why make an exception for me?
Because... Oh, enough of this!{LF}The reason doesn't matter, does it?
I'd like to know! You should talk to{LF}everyone! Come on, tell me why you {LF}don't.
It's nothing special. It's{LF}just...that I don't hate you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Wait, do you mean you like me?
I never said that I liked you!{LF}I just said that I didn't hate{LF}you!
But... How about you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? Do you like me?
I...
I like you, Orland.
I like you as a friend, Orland.
I like you, Orland.
...
...
Really?
Hey! What kind of reply is that?{LF}I'm telling you that I like you!
...
Thank you.
I'm happy.
Thanks!
Let's get married, then.
What?!
To the church!
M-Married...?!
I like you as a friend, Orland.
That's why I want you to get along{LF}with everyone else, too!
Well, maybe one day.
Oh, don't say things like that!
Anyway, that's all I had to say.{LF}See you, ＠アルス＠＠.
I'm sure I'll see you again soon.
All right, now get out of here.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I've got nothing more to say.
Look at you, all happy just because{LF}it's spring. So what?!
Why does summer have to be so hot? I{LF}can't stand all this pointless sweating.
Fall is nice and cool. Now is the{LF}time to do anything you need to get {LF}done.
All this snow in winter makes it so hard {LF}to get around. Cammy and Roy always {LF}throw snowballs at me, too. It's all so {LF}annoying!
What do you want? There's nothing {LF}going on here, nothing fun to see.
School is the place for lessons. {LF}Mess around, make too much {LF}noise in here, and I'll get angry.
I like dishes using fish.{LF}Things like ＠アイテム９＠{LF}and ＠アイテム６＠.
Why do you think monsters attack people?
When I see you try so hard at{LF}everything, it makes me want to{LF}try harder, too.
You defeated monsters in the woods?{LF}Well done.
You defeated monsters on Blessia Island?{LF}Hmmm, you must be stronger than you {LF}look.
You're getting stronger and stronger.{LF}
You defeated monsters in the Padova{LF}Mountains? I think I underestimated {LF}you.
I never thought you'd pull that one off.{LF}Well done.
I think your father is just like you.
I don't have time for games now.
I don't have time for games now.
This is your sword, isn't it, Tanya?{LF}Julia found it and told me to bring it {LF}to you.
Ah! I forgot it at Julia's bathhouse!{LF}I've been looking all over for it. I was{LF}starting to think I'd lost it for good!
I see. Well, here you go.
I'm sorry. The more precious something{LF}is to me, the easier it seems to be to {LF}forget where I left it!
Still, I would have thought a sword{LF}would be pretty hard to forget...
Well, you see...it was a long day,{LF}and I'd had a couple of drinks...
I'm glad you found it, anyway.{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}And thank Julia for me, too.
It was no problem.{LF}I'll let Julia know, too.
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.{LF}I really like ＠アイテム９＠.
T-h-a-n-k-s! Thank you!|
Oh, that's lovely! Is that for me?
It may just look like junk to you,{LF}but to me, it's t-r-e-a-s-u-re,{LF}baby, treasure!|
I'll take that, gladly! T-h-a-n-k-s!|
That's a ＠アイテム７＠, isn't it...?{LF}I don't really like that, I'm afraid.{LF}I hope you didn't go out of your way to {LF}get it...
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.{LF}I really like ＠アイテム９＠.
T-h-a-n-k-s! Thank you!|
Oh, that's lovely! Is that for me?
It may just look like junk to you,{LF}but to me, it's t-r-e-a-s-u-re,{LF}baby, treasure!|
I'll take that, gladly! T-h-a-n-k-s!|
That's a ＠アイテム７＠, isn't it...?{LF}I don't really like that, I'm afraid.{LF}I hope you didn't go out of your way to {LF}get it...
Tanya, please, drink this.
Oh, what is it?{LF}Let me have a try, then...
Nice of you to come by.{LF}Can I interest you in a weapon...?
This is for you.
This is for you.
Oh, what is it?{LF}Let me have a try, then...
Thanks for being such a good friend to{LF}Roy.
Oh, that's lovely. Is it for me? This is{LF}like...a birthday present, isn't it!
Oh, that's lovely. Is it for me? This is{LF}like...a birthday present, isn't it!
Is this a birthday present for me?{LF}Great! Thanks.
Is this a birthday present for me?{LF}Great! Thanks.
You've already given me a lovely{LF}present, thank you. I couldn't possibly {LF}take anything else from me.
You've already given me a lovely{LF}present, thank you. I couldn't possibly {LF}take anything else from me.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Oh, what's brought this on?{LF}A present, for me?
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Oh, what's brought this on?{LF}A present, for me?
There's nothing better than drinking{LF}while looking at weapons! Fantastic!
There's nothing better than drinking{LF}while looking at weapons! Fantastic! I {LF}can't believe you haven't experienced {LF}this, ＠カイル＠＠!
That drink really made me feel better. {LF}A bit more of this and I'll put on a {LF}real show for you! A little dancing, a {LF}little singing...
That drink really made me feel better. {LF}A bit more of this and I'll put on a {LF}real show for you! A little dancing, a {LF}little singing...
You'd better not stand too close,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! Ah hah hah hah!
Being outside always makes me want to{LF}swing a blade!
Look at this sword. Its deep, unique{LF}sparkle...! It just takes you{LF}p-r-i-s-o-n-e-r, doesn't it?!
Look at this sword. The ultimate in{LF}economic and functional yet beautiful {LF}design. Like polished s-i-l-v-e-r, baby.
This sword...glittering silver, as{LF}though it can slice through anything! So {LF}cold that even winter can't match it!
Hey, have you seen a big, sharp{LF}sword anywhere around here? {LF}I wonder where I left it...
You call this heat? It's nothing{LF}compared to the heat of an open forge {LF}when working a new sword.
Fall is the time to collect swords!{LF}How about adding a new blade to your {LF}collection?
A snowman might be the perfect practice {LF}dummy...
Oh, here for a bath too, are you? The{LF}baths here are the best. So refreshing!
Oh, here for a bath too, are you?{LF}That's a coincidence.
Only one thing I don't like about{LF}bathing. You have to leave all your {LF}weapons outside the tub.
I spend quite a lot of time in Julia's{LF}shop. Ah, what a refreshing bath!
A hot bath on a cold day is the best,{LF}isn't it?!
I need to get home before I freeze up!
I'd like to talk!
I'd like to buy something!
Just passing through...
Welcome! Spring is a great time{LF}to buy a one-handed blade!
Welcome! There's no better summer{LF}workout than to swing a hefty two-{LF}handed sword! I think you'd look great{LF}with a blade about as tall as you are!
Welcome! I think a nice, sharp spear{LF}would go perfectly with your outfit!
Welcome! Hmmm, for some reason... I see{LF}a hammer in yours hands, rather than a {LF}sword.
Okay. See you!
You're here to take a look at my{LF}collection, are you?
Okay, well, where to start...
You're here to take a look at my{LF}collection, are you?
I've been wanting to show you this{LF}piece, actually...
Maybe next time...
You're here to take a look at my{LF}collection, are you?
A little disclaimer first, I think.{LF}You can look, but don't touch, and{LF}definitely no taking home.
You're here to take a look at my{LF}collection, are you?
You've finally come to understand the{LF}true beauty in swords, have you?
Oh, I haven't seen you around{LF}here before.
Yeah, I'm new here. My name is{LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'll be living at the{LF}farm just outside of town.
Ah, yes... Douglas was telling me{LF}about you. My name is Tanya.{LF}Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too, Tanya!
So, ＠カイル＠＠, are you{LF}interested in swords? Blades?{LF}Sharp objects of any kind?
Well, um, not obsessively...
Oh, that's a shame. I am!{LF}Obsessed, I mean. Just{LF}can't get enough of them!
O-Okay... Whatever does it for{LF}you, I guess...
Unfortunately, though, monsters{LF}never come into town, so I don't{LF}have a chance to try my blades{LF}out on any of them... *sigh*...
Oh... That's too bad... I guess.
Indeed it is! Anyway, let's talk{LF}about you, ＠カイル＠＠! I feel{LF}every true man should own at{LF}least one sword!
Th-They should...?
Yes, they should! Should you decide{LF}to become a real man yourself,{LF}come on by! I'll show you all sorts{LF}of fine weaponry!
Uh, okay, thanks... I'll keep that{LF}in mind...
Oh, and one more thing! Just owning{LF}a sword will make you stronger, but{LF}you should also look for Skill Seals! 
Skill Seals let you use powerful{LF}weapon moves! Here, I've got{LF}a spare one that you can have.{LF}Try it out!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
What is this...?
A Skill Seal for a shortsword.{LF}Equip it along with the correct weapon {LF}to use it.
There are lots of other Skill Seals out{LF}there. But that's the only one I've{LF}got for you.
I hope you can find more!
Thank you!
Oh, looks like you've got your hands{LF}full. Why not make some room and ask me {LF}again?
Good morning.
Hello.
Good evening.
Ah, good morning.
Good day, love.
Ah, good evening.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Can I interest you in a new sword?
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Can I interest you in a new sword?
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Can I interest you in a new sword?
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You're looking sharp today!
Good day, love!{LF}You're looking sharp today!
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You're looking sharp today!
Morning.
Oh, it's you ＠アルス＠＠!
Good evening! You'd better get home,{LF}it's late.
Happy new year! Another year of swords{LF}lies ahead, ＠カイル＠＠.
Happy new year! Another year of swords{LF}lies ahead, ＠アルス＠＠.
It's the Flower Festival today. To be{LF}honest, I'd rather have a nice drink{LF}and check out some new swords,{LF}but that's just me, I guess.
It's the Flower Festival today. To be{LF}honest, I'd rather have a nice drink{LF}and check out some new swords,{LF}but that's just me, I guess.
Ah, festivals, festivals!{LF}I think its about time we started a{LF}sword festival, don't you?
That would be wayyyy more exciting!
Oh, you won? Wow. I'm impressed!
Oh, what a shame. You need to train{LF}more!
It might be a festival, but if I can't{LF}use my sword in some way then I'm not {LF}all that bothered. To be honest.
Wow, I never would have picked you for{LF}being so good at this.
Oh, bad luck. You need to get into it{LF}more, don't you.
Swimming season starts today.{LF}Roy has been raring to get in the{LF}water since this morning.
He really does love to play outside.
Swimming season starts today.{LF}Roy has been raring to get in the{LF}water since this morning.
Why don't you play with him, too?
It's the Monster Taming Contest today.
Bringing a monster under control with a{LF}sword! Is there anything more wonderful?
I think...the key to this tournament{LF}is to get along well with your monsters, {LF}not rule them by fear.
Oh, really...?
Wow, fantastic! But I still say you{LF}would have gotten better results with{LF}a sword than that Pet Glove.
Oh, that's a shame. I'll bet you would{LF}have won if you'd used a sharp sword{LF}instead of that wimpy Pet Glove.
It's the Monster Taming Contest today.{LF}I admit, I have some interest in the {LF}weapons that monsters use.
Wow, well done! It's pretty hard to get{LF}along that well with monsters!
That wasn't so good, was it. Handling{LF}monsters is harder than it looks.
Dancing is a lot like sword fighting,{LF}you know. Both require grace and fine{LF}footwork. But sword fighting requires{LF}a lot more chopping.
Dancing is a lot like sword fighting,{LF}you know. Both require grace and fine{LF}footwork. But sword fighting requires{LF}a lot more chopping.
It's the Fishing Contest today. I don't{LF}really see you as much of a fisherman,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Impressive skills!{LF}I didn't think you had it in you.
Hmmm... I think you could have{LF}done better.
It's the Big Cook-Off today. There are{LF}lots of delicious things you can cook, {LF}even at your age ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You may even win!
Impressive skills. Maybe I should get{LF}Roy to start cooking too.
The contest is for cookery, not just{LF}charring. I probably could have done {LF}better.
It's the Adventure Contest today.{LF}Are you ready to head on out?
Wow, you did well!{LF}Did my sword help you out?
You were a little slow there.{LF}I think you need better equipment!
It's the Adventure Contest today. If{LF}you are going to take part, you'd{LF}better pick up the best gear you{LF}can from my store first!
Wow, you did well!{LF}Did my sword help you out?
You were a little slow there.{LF}I think you need better equipment!
It's the Harvest Festival today.{LF}Farming's your game isn't it?{LF}It's like a holiday for you!
I guess so. I'm serious about{LF}farming. As serious as you are about {LF}swords.
That's pretty serious! Now if only{LF}we had a Sword Festival...!
I think that...might be a little{LF}dangerous...
It's the Harvest Festival today. Your{LF}time to shine! Bring on the tasty {LF}veggies!
Ah, the Monster Contest. Don't you{LF}think it'd be more exciting if we{LF}gave all the monsters swords and had{LF}them fight?
Uh, it would be...but it might{LF}also be a little dangerous.
Really? I was thinking it might be a{LF}good chance for my shop to rake in some {LF}cash...
Superb! Your monster really tore it up{LF}out there, ＠カイル＠＠! I reckon{LF}it would have done even better if it was {LF}equipped with a sword, though...
You lost?! If you wanted to win, you{LF}really should have slipped your monster {LF}a sword before the contest started.
The Monster Contest, hm? I think it's{LF}kind of dull to just show a monster.{LF}It's much more exciting to fight them!
Superb! Your monster really tore it up{LF}out there! I reckon it would have done {LF}even better if it was equipped with a {LF}sword, though...
You lost?! If you wanted to win, you{LF}really should have slipped your monster {LF}a sword before the battle started.
It's the Shooting Star Festival tonight.{LF}A sword glittering in the faint light of {LF}the stars is so mysterious, so {LF}beautiful...
It's the Shooting Star Festival tonight. {LF}A sword glittering in the faint light of {LF}the stars is so mysterious, so {LF}beautiful...
It's the Mining Contest today. {LF}I wonder if I could slice a rock open{LF}with my sharpest sword. Hmm...
Wow, well done!
Hey! You'd better not tell me you're{LF}switching to a hammer now, okay?!
That didn't really go as you planned,{LF}did it?
Don't worry. Even if you can't use{LF}hammers, you can always fall back on{LF}swords! Not literally, of course! Ow!
It's the Mining Contest today.{LF}I guess even really sharp swords{LF}aren't the best tools for breaking{LF}rocks.
Wow, well done!
Hey! You'd better not tell me you're{LF}switching to a hammer now, okay?!
That didn't really go as you planned,{LF}did it?
Don't worry. Even if you can't use{LF}hammers, you can always fall back on {LF}swords! Not literally, of course! Ow!
It's New Year's Eve. Time to think back{LF}over another year spent, and consider {LF}how to kick off the next one. Another {LF}year of great swords ahead!

I'm just patrolling the town, checking{LF}that everything is okay. Anything to {LF}report?
Nothing in particular.{LF}But good work, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Tanya. Roy wants me to talk to{LF}you. He said he isn't ready to take{LF}over the weapon shop yet.
Hello, Tanya. Roy wants me to talk to{LF}you. He said he isn't ready to take{LF}over the weapon shop yet.
Oh dear, Roy said that? I didn't know{LF}he didn't want to take over the shop...{LF}I just always assume everyone likes the{LF}sharp cut of a blade as much as I do!
Thanks for letting me know, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Maybe he'll change his mind some day.{LF}At any rate, let him know I won't talk{LF}about it for now.
Okay! No problem!
Okay! No problem!
Hey... You don't fancy taking over,{LF}do you? I'd welcome you with open{LF}arms! I'll gladly train you!
Uh... Thanks, but no thanks...
Uh... Thanks, but no thanks...
Ah, what a shame!
Okay, I'll let Roy know what you{LF}told me!
Okay, I'll let Roy know what you{LF}told me!
Roy may not want to take over the{LF}family business now, but I'm sure{LF}he'll change his mind in a few{LF}years!
Tanya, you look like you've got{LF}something you want to ask me...
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thank you for coming. Well, rather than{LF}something to ask... I've got a trial for{LF}you.
What? A trial...?
That's right. T-r-i-a-l, baby! Trial!{LF}A trial in order to raise your skills as {LF}a swordsman!|
I see...
Hmmm. You don't sound very interested.
Now listen. You're going into the forest {LF}and you're going to fight monsters.
If you're going to live around here,{LF}then you'll find you need go into the{LF}forests every now and then to{LF}fight some monsters!
With your current pathetic sword{LF}skills, those monsters will tear you{LF}apart! Shred you! Rend you! Send you{LF}off to the a-f-t-e-r-l-i-f-e!
Uhh...don't you think you're{LF}exaggerating a little?
EXAGGERATING?! This is life and death!{LF}You have to take it seriously! No{LF}wonder you're such a terrible{LF}swordsman!
You don't want to die, now do you? So{LF}you need to become stronger in order to {LF}protect yourself.
In other words, improving your skills as {LF}a swordsman is s-u-p-e-r important.
Oh, I know what you're thinking!{LF}You think all you need to do it get{LF}your hands on a flashy, expensive{LF}sword, right?
Even the best sword is a waste of metal {LF}in the hands of the unskilled fighter!
It's obvious to me that you can't handle {LF}yourself yet. Obvious to any monster who {LF}sees you, too.
I don't want to sell any of my swords{LF}to someone who can't use them!
So these trials are also a test by me to {LF}see if you are worthy of the best swords {LF}I can make.
I'll say it again. Sword skills are{LF}s-u-p-e-r important!|
Okay. I think I see where this is going.
Good. Don't forget that.
I'm glad you understand.{LF}Let's get stared, then.
As a...warm up, shall we shall, why{LF}don't you go and pick on an{LF}＠モンスター９＠? I think you{LF}should be able to handle that.
Okay, how about you defeat ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s and then come{LF}back to me?
Defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s...{LF}I understand.
Trieste Forest is the territory of {LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
It's a very violent monster, wielding a{LF}large club.
You can reach Trieste Forest by heading{LF}further north from the town's north {LF}square.
Then you'll come to a three-way fork in{LF}the road. Take the path on the right to {LF}reach Trieste Forest.
Well, go on then! Off you go!
Okay.
Oh, and one last thing.
Don't go getting yourself k-i-l-l-e-d{LF}out there!| Take care!|
Ah ha ha... Yeah, I'll be careful.
You're here for another trial?
Well then, come back to me once you've{LF}defeated ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Very well.
Trieste Forest is the territory of{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Now go and get some action!
Very well! Come back to me once you've{LF}defeated ＠数字８＠ {LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Trieste Forest is the territory of{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
It's a very violent monster, wielding a{LF}large club.
It looks like you've managed to defeat{LF}the required ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
Don't go getting full of yourself,{LF}though, having only defeated{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Here's your reward! ＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Oh, I've got something else for you,{LF}too.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you.
Any time you want to try another {LF}challenge, just come on back. Cleaning {LF}up monsters helps everyone out, in the {LF}end!
Oh, your hands are full.{LF}Please make some room first!
Oh, I've got something else for you,{LF}too.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Ah, there you are, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I want you to tackle ＠モンスター９＠s{LF}this time.
This will probably be tougher than your{LF}last trial, but you need to keep on {LF}pushing yourself and aiming higher!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
Do your best!
Ah, here for another trial!
Okay then, come back to me once you have{LF}defeated at least ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Very well.
Trieste Forest is the territory of{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
I expect nothing less than your best!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.
It looks like you've managed to defeat{LF}the required ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
You've gotten some valuable weapons{LF}practice! Good job!
Don't get lazy, though! You've still{LF}got a long way to go before you're{LF}a master swordsman!
Here's your reward. ＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you.
Oh yeah, I'll give you some battle{LF}h-i-n-t-s.
The secret to battle is to watch your{LF}foe closely! Each monster always {LF}performs a unique tell-tale sign before {LF}they attack.
Understand? First you need to watch and{LF}learn the attacks of your foes! Then {LF}you'll spot a chance to strike.
Any time you want to try another {LF}challenge, just come on back. {LF}Cleaning up monsters helps {LF}everyone out in the end!
You're here for a new trial, aren't you?{LF}Excellent.
This one might give you some trouble,{LF}but here we go. Take out ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Keep your wits about you, you hear?
Let your guard down and you'll d-i-e{LF}for sure!|
Ah hah hah hah...ha?
You know the drill. {LF}Come back to me once{LF}you have defeated at least ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Blessia Island is the territory of{LF}the ＠モンスター９＠.
Do your best!
Ah, here for another trial!
Okay then, come back to me {LF}once you have{LF}defeated at least ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Very well.
Blessia Island is the territory of{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
I expect nothing less than your best!
Come back to me once {LF}you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
Blessia Island is the territory of{LF}＠モンスター９＠.
It looks like you've managed to defeat{LF}the required ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
How was it? Tough?
If you're having a lot of trouble,{LF}maybe you should buy a different{LF}weapon! I sell all kinds of fabulous{LF}weapons here, you know!|
You made it back safely, though.{LF}Well done!
Here's your reward. ＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you.
I'll give you another battle hint now,{LF}then.
Each dungeon has two types of monster, {LF}those that are active in the daytime and {LF}those that are active at night.
Even if you've been somewhere before, {LF}have you been there both in the day time {LF}and at night? You might find something {LF}new at different times of day.
Any time you want to try another {LF}challenge, just come on back. Chop your {LF}way through those monsters!
Oh, you saw the bulletin board,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I have something I want to talk{LF}to you about...
Your dad was quite a skillful{LF}fighter.
He took out powerful monsters one after{LF}the other, and really honed his skills.
The number of monsters he defeated,{LF}why, there aren't enough stars in{LF}the sky to count them...
People were even starting to whisper{LF}about him being the next legendary {LF}swordsman!
My dad was that strong...? Mom never{LF}said anything about that...
My dad was that strong...? Mom never{LF}said anything about that...
He really was amazingly skilled.{LF}Therefore...
That means that YOU need to become a{LF}skilled fighter, just like your{LF}father was!|
I want you to train hard, and become{LF}skilled with a blade, too!
You want me to train to be...a{LF}fighter?
You want me to train to be...a{LF}fighter?
That's right! They don't teach you that{LF}in school, do they?
Uh... No.
Uh... No.
And what kind of training do you need{LF}in order to become a great fighter?{LF}Trials, that's what!
Trials...?
Trials...?
Yes, trials! So, without further ado,{LF}let's get started, then!
Um... Okay...
Um... Okay...
To start with, head to Trieste Forest.
Defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s, then{LF}come back and talk to me.
Oh, you're not scared of monsters,{LF}are you, ＠アルス＠＠?
No, I'm not scared.
No, I'm not scared.
Good! That's the first step to becoming {LF}a fighter like your father! Now, head{LF}off to Trieste Forest!
Okay!
Okay!
Ah, here for another trial, are you?
Okay then, come back to me once you have{LF}defeated at least ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Very well.
Very well.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.
I expect nothing less than your best!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.
Great! It looks like you've managed to{LF}defeat the required number of{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
Your sword skills have surely improved{LF}then, correct?
However, this is only the beginning!{LF}There's still plenty more I need{LF}you to do!
In any case, here's your reward.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, that reminds me...
If you want to become even stronger,{LF}you'll need to build a Dojo! Then{LF}you'll be able to learn all sorts of {LF}useful combat skills!
Let me spell it out for you -- a{LF}Dojo is SUPER important! Remember{LF}that! Talk to the mayor when you{LF}want to build one!
Any time you want to try another {LF}challenge, just come on back. I'll turn {LF}you into a lean, mean, fighting machine!
Here for a trial, are you?
That's great! More trials and{LF}fighting is always a good thing!
This time, I want you to defeat{LF}＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s for me, okay?
You already seem pretty skilled, so{LF}this shouldn't be a problem for you.
My only advice is: Don't let your{LF}guard down.
You can find ＠モンスター９＠s in{LF}Trieste Forest.
Now then, off you go!
Take care out there!
Ah, here for another trial, are you?
Okay then, come back to me once you have{LF}defeated at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
Very well.
Very well.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.
I expect nothing less than your best!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.
Impressive! You defeated the ＠モンスター９＠s!
Just like I thought you would.{LF}You've got sword skills, just{LF}like your father.
I've have a reward for you.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'll give you another battle hint,{LF}then.
I'll sell you stronger weapons{LF}once you have the skills needed{LF}to wield them.
If you want really powerful weapons...{LF}Well, you'll just need to defeat the{LF}bigger  monsters in the depths of the{LF}dungeons!|
Keep it up, ＠アルス＠＠!
You're starting to make your sword {LF}your own. Good. Let's push you{LF}a little today...
I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s, okay?
Ants are nocturnal, so they'll only{LF}come out at night.
Watch your back out there! You might{LF}just get chomped from behind!
Ah, here for another trial?
Let's push you a little today.
I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s, okay?
They're nocturnal, meaning you'll have{LF}to hunt for them once it gets dark.
Keep your wits about you!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
＠モンスター９＠s live in Trieste Forest.

Welcome back. Glad to see you safe and{LF}sound.
I knew it. You've got potential.{LF}Real potential.
Here's your reward!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
And so, here you go! Battle hint number {LF}two!
If you build a Forge, you can make{LF}your own weapons! You need to talk to{LF}the mayor about building a Workshop{LF}at your school first, though!
There are lots of weapons that can only{LF}be obtained by making them yourself. If {LF}you've gathered enough materials, then {LF}try making one!
Ah, I can't wait to see the kinds of{LF}weapons you'll make at your forge!|
You've come for a trial?{LF}Here's the rundown for today,{LF}then.
I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
It's a plant monster, so it can't move,{LF}but underestimate this guy at{LF}your own peril.
Still, it might be interesting if you{LF}could tame it. Keep your wits about you. {LF}Now, off you go!|
You've come for a trial?{LF}Here's the rundown for today,{LF}then.
I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.

How did you like my choice of{LF}monster for you this time?
Well, anyway, here's your reward.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You're making good progress.{LF}Keep it up!
Well then, its time for hint number{LF}three.
Escape magic is pretty useful.{LF}It'll safely take you back to the {LF}entrance to a dungeon in an instant, {LF}no matter where you are inside.
But if you use Escape again from{LF}the dungeon entrance, you'll be{LF}whisked all the way back home!{LF}Magic sure is useful...!
Come back for another trial soon!{LF}Bye-bye!|
Ah, welcome! It's trial time, then!
This time out, I want you to defeat{LF}some ＠モンスター９＠s. Can you beat{LF}＠数字８＠ of them for me?
This one's pretty tricky, so{LF}you'd better be careful.
Just do your best. That's all I can ask!
Ah, welcome! It's trial time, then!

If you're starting to have trouble{LF}out there, you might want to invest{LF}in some stronger weapons.
Here's your reward.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You know those battle hints I've{LF}been giving you? Well, here's{LF}a fourth one!
You can equip a shield if you are using{LF}a staff. Sounds like a good deal,{LF}doesn't it? But I still say you can't{LF}do better than a blade!
Come back for another trial soon!{LF}Bye-bye!|
Right, I've got a trial for you again{LF}today!
This time out, your target is a{LF}＠モンスター９＠. Can you defeat{LF}＠数字８＠ of them for me?
If you want some advice, I'd suggest{LF}taking it to close combat if long range {LF}isn't working out for you.
Good luck out there!|

Oh. Let me just slip in a plug for my{LF}shop. The weapons I sell change {LF}depending on the season.
Spring is Shortswords, Summer{LF}is Longswords, Fall is Lances,{LF}and Winter is Hammers.
Well, that's it for the advertising.{LF}See you!
Came for a trial again today?
This time out, I want you to defeat{LF}some ＠モンスター９＠s. Can you beat ＠数字８＠ of{LF}them?
I've heard reports of ＠モンスター９＠{LF}sightings in a place in Trieste Forest {LF}with a great view!
I think this one might prove to be a{LF}little tough! Good luck!|
Oh, good for you!{LF}Heading out on a trial again today!
This time out, I want to turn your{LF}attention to the ＠モンスター９＠.{LF}Can you defeat ＠数字８＠ of them{LF}and then come back?

Here's your reward. Well done,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
No matter how many monsters you take{LF}out in the forest, their numbers just{LF}don't change, do they? I wonder if{LF}there's anything we can do about that.
At any rate, it looks like Trieste{LF}Forest no longer offers a challenge{LF}for you. You've made real progress,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Here for a trial, are you?
Starting today, I'll be sending you{LF}on trials to Blessia Island.
Blessia Island is the uninhabited island{LF}to the southeast of town. Well,{LF}uninhabited by humans... There are{LF}plenty of monsters there.
The weather is summery throughout the{LF}year, so it's the perfect place for some {LF}swimming. And an Aquasword would go {LF}perfectly with that swim suit!
Anyway, it's trial time!
Can you defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s{LF}for me?
You can't underestimate the speed of{LF}these guys.
Do your best, and don't drop your{LF}guard!
Ah, here for another trial!
Come back to me once you have defeated{LF}at least ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.

Welcome back! It looks like you{LF}managed to do it!
Did the monsters on Blessia Island give {LF}you much trouble? They're a tough bunch {LF}over there!
They tend to be weak against magic,{LF}though. Remember that!
Here's your reward!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I've got plenty more trials to put you{LF}through yet!
Here for a trial, are you?
Good to see! We'll make a warrior out{LF}of you yet!

I've got a reward for you, as well!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Another step closer to becoming a true{LF}warrior! Keep it up, ＠アルス＠＠!|
That sword is really starting to look{LF}natural on you. I'm going to push you a {LF}little this time.
This time, I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠{LF}＠モンスター９＠s.
They're nocturnal, meaning you'll have{LF}to hunt for them once it gets dark.
They're not as strong as they look,{LF}so you should be able to deal with{LF}them pretty easily. They can get{LF}nasty when they're angry, though!

I think this one might prove to be a{LF}little tough! It's covered in fire,{LF}so you might want to try a water {LF}weapon.
If you want another piece of advice, the {LF}monster will come at you with special {LF}attacks, so you might want to keep your {LF}distance. How about using a spear...?
Anyway, just do your best not to get{LF}hurt!|

A-Anyway, you are now a master{LF}fighter, ＠アルス＠＠! Well done{LF}to you!
Here for a trial, are you?
Now we'll move on to the Padova {LF}Mountains. There's some nasty{LF}characters up there.
We'll start with ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠.
Just so we're clear on this, the {LF}Padova Mountains are full of {LF}dangerous enemies. Very few people {LF}ever come back alive.
I believe in you, ＠アルス＠＠! Go show {LF}those enemies the fruits of all your{LF}trials!
Another trial, is it?

But, training is training,{LF}in any case!
I want you to defeat ＠数字８＠ ＠モンスター９＠s.
Even I don't know much about them. {LF}I know you don't want to let your{LF}guard down around them, that's for {LF}sure.
But I'm sure you'll be fine,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
But...you just said you don't{LF}know much about them...

Tanya...you ARE afraid of {LF}ghosts, aren't you?
Tanya...you ARE afraid of {LF}ghosts, aren't you?
Ack! Those are some sharp {LF}instincts you got there, kid.
What place do ghosts have in our {LF}world anyway? Am I right?
Well, truth be told, I suppose they're {LF}not of our world. That's why they're {LF}ghosts. Bunch of pests.
...

This one's extremely powerful. You'll {LF}need to mix up your attacks with {LF}well-timed dodges to come out on top!
Also, it's incredibly fast, and{LF}attacks with a special kind of{LF}magic. Perhaps a spear would{LF}be best against it?
Good luck out there!

What?! But...you know so much {LF}about monsters...
What?! But...you know so much {LF}about monsters...
Ohhh, that. I'm just repeating what I {LF}hear from other people!
Adventurers from all over the world {LF}come to me for weapons. I pick up {LF}juicy tips from them all the time!
I'm just a weapons dealer, though my {LF}love and knowledge of them {LF}admittedly knows no bounds!
It's ME who should be thanking YOU{LF}for increasing my sales! Ha ha ha!
Uh... Glad I could be of service!

Don't get careless! It'll take any{LF}opening you give it!
Good luck out there!
You did it! Amazing!
Here's your reward!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You continue to amaze me as{LF}always, ＠アルス＠＠!
Come for a challenge, have you? We {LF}got another big one!
This time, I want you to defeat{LF}Crystal Mammoth.
It uses particularly powerful magic, {LF}but it's nothing you can't handle.
Good luck out there!
Ready for another challenge today?
Go defeat Crystal Mammoth.
Don't let your guard down. Good luck!
Once you've defeated Crystal {LF}Mammoth, come back and see me {LF}again.
Crystal Mammoth can be found in the {LF}Padova Mountains.
Don't get careless, now!
Good luck out there!
Welcome back, Legendary Fighter{LF}＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Ha ha ha!
Here's your reward!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone {LF}left capable of taking you on,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Mmmm, I'm sooo tired...spring's here {LF}again.
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival.
Don't be surprised if you see me with {LF}a drink in my hand having some fun.
That was some earthquake we had. It {LF}jarred a lot of the weapons loose. {LF}Scared the life out of me.
We were lucky it wasn't any bigger, {LF}otherwise who knows what could've {LF}happened.
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest. If one {LF}of the prizes is a sword, make sure {LF}you win!
Tomorrow's the start of swimming{LF}season. You should see how{LF}excited Roy is.
He probably won't be able to sleep {LF}tonight, ha ha ha.
Tomorrow's the Monster Taming {LF}Contest. You have to be careful {LF}when approaching monsters. {LF}Be sure you have one of our swords!
There goes another earthquake. They {LF}always knock all my weapons to the {LF}floor! It makes me so angry!
Everyone looks bothered by the heat.
You don't seem that bothered by it, {LF}Tanya. 
I work with a hot forge every day.{LF}This is nothing for me!
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Tomorrow's the Dance Festival. I used {LF}to dance a lot when I was younger. I {LF}was quite the little charmer, I'll have {LF}you know.
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest. My {LF}favorite fish is pike.
It kinda resembles a sword, don't you {LF}think? That's what makes it the{LF}best fish ever!
Tomorrow's the Adventure Contest. {LF}You need to be thoroughly prepared {LF}before you head out!
Now might be a good time to restock {LF}your weapons.
Another blasted earthquake. A {LF}weapons shop is about the worst {LF}place in the world to be during an {LF}earthquake.
We need to come up with an {LF}emergency plan, just in case. {LF}A way outta here, you know?
If anything ever happens to me... {LF}promise me you'll look after the {LF}shop, will you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Waaait a second, I dunno about that...
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival. 
The leaves on the trees have started {LF}to change color. You also need to look {LF}after your body once it starts getting {LF}cold.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest. {LF}It seems kind of dull to me.{LF}I think we should give the monsters{LF}weapons and have them fight!
Nobody else seems to like the idea,{LF}though.
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star {LF}Festival. Apparently shooting stars {LF}contain rare ores. I'd like to get my {LF}hands on some for a weapon.
It's gotten pretty cold outside lately. {LF}It's hot as ever in here, though.
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest. If you {LF}find any good ores, be sure to give {LF}them to me, okay?
You feel that earthquake? All the {LF}weapons were rattling around again!{LF}It's scary, I tell you.
Tomorrow's the last day of the year. {LF}I collected a lot of swords this year. {LF}It's never enough, though.
The cherry blossoms are everywhere,{LF}aren't they? They're beautiful. It'd{LF}be an interesting challenge to try to{LF}cut one as it was falling.
Hot as ever today. This is nothing {LF}compared to the temperature of {LF}the forge, though.
The leaves on the trees have started {LF}to change color. You also need to look {LF}after your body once it starts getting {LF}cold.
It's gotten pretty cold outside lately. {LF}It's hot as ever in here with the {LF}forge, though.
We're the best place in town{LF}when it comes to weapons.
Be sure to remember us for all your {LF}combat needs!

Be sure to remember us for all your {LF}combat needs!
What do you think of Alvarna? It's the {LF}kind of place you could settle down {LF}and grow old, don't you think?
I always find it tough to eat first{LF}thing in the morning. Ha ha ha.
I like to keep a sword by me when I {LF}eat. It ensures that I get great{LF}service in restaurants!
Food even tastes better when I'm {LF}looking at a sword.
I like any fruit, but my favorite is {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
I like both eating ＠アイテム９＠ and {LF}peeling it.

I hope you and Roy will be good {LF}friends. He's got plenty of energy, so {LF}good luck!
I hope you and Roy will be good {LF}friends. Sometimes he's a little too {LF}much for me to handle, ha ha ha. He {LF}gets up to all kinds of mischief.
You should play with Roy sometime. {LF}He's always looking for someone to {LF}play with.
You have no idea where you come {LF}from, do you?
That's right. I've lost my memory.
I hope you get it back soon. Must be {LF}hard not knowing who you are.
They say Norad is where humans {LF}first came from. It's rich in history, {LF}this country.
Swords have a long history. They say {LF}they've used swords for hunting since {LF}the olden days.
They say Norad is where humans {LF}first came from. This country has {LF}such a rich history.
It's said humans have been using {LF}swords since ancient times.
Look at this dagger, ＠カイル＠＠. Nice {LF}design to it, don't you think?
Check out the big ruby in the {LF}scabbard. It's just gorgeous.
Look at this sword, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Nice design to it, don't you think?
Check out all the jewels in the {LF}handle. It's just gorgeous.
Look at this sword, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Powerful-looking, don't you think?
I could never handle it myself, but it's {LF}amazing just looking at it.
Look at how sharp the ＠アイテム８＠ is.
It's just...intoxicating.

It gets really hot when you're forging {LF}metal. Sweat just drips off your {LF}forehead.
I'll bet. It must take its toll on you.
But taking a bath afterwards feels {LF}sooo good.

Part of me likes it because of that.
In the east they have a saying,{LF}"A wound inflicted by a strong will {LF}does not heal easily."
I'm not sure why, but apparently {LF}those kinds of wounds do have a {LF}tendency to not heal. I wouldn't like {LF}that, would you?
In the east they have a saying,{LF}"A wound inflicted by a strong will {LF}does not heal easily."
I'm not sure why, but apparently {LF}those kinds of wounds do heal {LF}slower. One of the mysteries of {LF}the eastern lands, perhaps.

I don't like ＠アイテム７＠.
It's hard to cut through.

How about I make you a sword for {LF}your birthday?
Oh, that's right. You don't remember {LF}your birthday. I'm sorry.
By the way, my birthday is the 21st {LF}of winter. Don't you forget it, now!

What do you think of the store?
If you ever need anything, don't {LF}hesitate to let me know!
What do you think of the store?
If you ever need anything, don't {LF}hesitate to let me know! Anything {LF}within reason, that is.
What do you think of the store?
If you ever need anything, don't {LF}hesitate to let me know! Just don't be {LF}stingy, otherwise I'll have to chase {LF}you out.
Working in the fields looks tough. {LF}You seem to be doing a good job, {LF}though.
I'm not pushing myself too hard at {LF}the moment.
You don't want to overdo it, okay?
Working in the fields looks tough. {LF}You seem to be doing a good job, {LF}though.
I'm doing the best I can.

I'm doing the best I can.
It's nice to take a break from {LF}everything once in a while.
You can't make anything without the {LF}right ores. It's not easy excavating {LF}them, though.
If you ever find any rare ores, be sure {LF}to show them to me! There are some {LF}things I still know nothing about in {LF}the world, believe it or not.
Shooting stars apparently have {LF}ores inside them you can't {LF}find anywhere else.
Thinking about it {LF}really gets me excited.
I haven't been able to make anything {LF}to my liking these days. Guess I {LF}must be in a slump or something.

Say, do you know what you want {LF}to be when you grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, I still don't know, really.
I do think farming might be fun, though.
I'm surprised you don't know. Roy {LF}helps out at the store, but he says {LF}he hates it.
I don't think I can count on him to {LF}take over the shop for me, ha ha ha.
Say, do you know what you want {LF}to be when you grow up, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, I still don't know, really.
I do think farming might be fun, though.
I'm surprised you don't know. When I {LF}was your age, I already knew I wanted {LF}to sell weapons.

Well, I still don't know, really.
I do think farming might be fun, though.
I'm surprised you don't know. I've {LF}always loved swords since I was little. {LF}It's been my dream to sell weapons {LF}ever since.
You should take your time, though. {LF}I don't suppose there's any hurry.
That Roy always goes running off {LF}somewhere.
There's nothing wrong with playing {LF}around when you're his age, but I {LF}just hope he isn't giving anyone else {LF}any trouble.
That Roy is always up to no good.
He really is a good kid deep down, {LF}but he's just so hyper. I don't know{LF}where he gets that...
That Roy is always up to no good.
He stays out so late. He never {LF}listens to me no matter what I say.
I always try to make my weapons as {LF}strong as possible.
But nothing's perfect. So be careful {LF}when you're using them, okay?
There's no such thing as a weapon {LF}that will never ever break.
I always try to make my weapons as {LF}strong as possible.
Nothing's worse than running out {LF}of materials before it's finished.
You should always prepare for the {LF}worst just in case.
I always try to make my weapons as {LF}strong as possible.
Nothing's worse than running out {LF}of materials before it's finished.
We all fall down sometimes. The {LF}important thing is to make sure {LF}you get back up.
Tell me, what kind of girl do you like?
What?! Well, good question...
Oh, look at you, all red. You're so {LF}cute. You don't have to take it that {LF}seriously.
Ha ha ha.
Tell me, what kind of girl do you like?
What?! Well, good question...
Oh, look at you, all red. You're so {LF}cute.
I think what you need is a nice little {LF}girl who's interested in swords.
I'm not sure there are any.
What kind of girl do you like?
What?! Well, good question...
Oh, look at you, all red. You're so {LF}cute. Don't take it too seriously, {LF}ha ha ha.
When you're working on a weapon, {LF}you get sparks that fly up everywhere.
One time some sparks landed on {LF}some furniture and started a small fire.
There's nothing wrong with getting {LF}really into it, but you still have to {LF}be careful, ha ha ha.
One time I had Roy try forging, and {LF}he yelled out, "Aaaahh it's hot!" and {LF}ran away.
He's such a wuss, ha ha ha.
One time I had Roy try forging, and {LF}he yelled out, "Aaaahh it's hot!" and {LF}ran away.
He just runs away and goes off to {LF}play. He's utterly hopeless.
Do you know about the Forest of {LF}Beginnings? Apparently it's filled with {LF}monsters. If you ever go there, be {LF}sure you have one of our weapons!
Do you know about the Forest of {LF}Beginnings? Apparently it's filled with {LF}monsters. I wouldn't want to go there {LF}even with my finest weapon in hand.
Do you know about the Forest of {LF}Beginnings? It might be worth {LF}checking out for you. I'd never go {LF}anywhere near there myself, though.
With things so peaceful, there's not {LF}much use for swords here, is there? {LF}There's nothing wrong with that, but I {LF}still feel like using a sword sometimes.
Like whenever I'm in the square.
Remind me never to go there when {LF}you're there.
Sometimes I feel like going to the {LF}city and just spending some time {LF}gathering up some new weapons.
Going to the far east{LF}would be heaven for me.
Ha ha ha.
Sometimes I feel like going to the {LF}city and just spending some time {LF}gathering up some new weapons.
Going to the far east would be nice. {LF}The katana is by far the most {LF}beautiful of all swords.
You can't make a sword unless you {LF}have the ore for it. Great swords{LF}start with great materials!
You really like swords, don't you, {LF}Tanya?
Of course! How could a person not love{LF}swords?! The very thought of someone{LF}not being able to appreciate a fine{LF}blade fills me with sadness!

You really like swords, don't you, {LF}Tanya?
Well, I don't like it when they're{LF}used for war, like when the Sechs{LF}Empire starts invading other countries.
If they're going to use it for something {LF}like that, they should just give them {LF}to me instead.
Are you familiar with the legend of the {LF}Elder Dragons?
They're incredibly powerful dragons.{LF}I'll bet their horns and fangs would{LF}make some pretty good weapons.
If you defeat one, be sure to bring {LF}its horns and fangs to me!{LF}Ha ha ha!
Are you familiar with the legend of the {LF}Elder Dragons?
They're incredibly powerful dragons.{LF}Who knows what you'd need to defeat{LF}such powerful monsters?

You're always helping me out with {LF}things, ＠カイル＠＠. Ever since you {LF}showed up here, my business has {LF}been booming.
There are still tons of swords{LF}I want to make, though, so keep{LF}up the good work.
You're always helping me out with {LF}things, ＠カイル＠＠. I've been able to {LF}make a ton of swords because of you.
There are still tons of swords{LF}I want to make, though, so keep{LF}up the good work.
You're always helping me out with {LF}things, ＠カイル＠＠. Your ability must {LF}have improved quite a bit by now.
You should use one of our swords for {LF}practice.
I wonder just how good you are with a {LF}sword, ＠アルス＠＠.
I don't think Roy likes school. He's {LF}just too rambunctious to sit and learn!
Do you enjoy school? Roy's always {LF}thinking of ways to get out of going.
When you were born, it was actually {LF}me who showed your mother how to {LF}take care of a baby.
You sure did have a loud cry. It'd {LF}take us forever to get you to zip it.
What do you think you'll do in the {LF}future? I'd like to see you become a {LF}fearsome warrior, personally.
I'm sure your mother wouldn't allow {LF}that, though.
Nothing beats having a drink while {LF}studying a sword, does it?
Nothing beats having a drink while {LF}studying a sword, does it? Well, {LF}you're a little young to know what {LF}I'm talking about.
I just had a drink, so I'm feeling {LF}preeetty good right now. You wanna {LF}see my sword dance? Ha ha ha.
I just had a drink, so I'm feeling {LF}preeetty good right now. You wanna {LF}see my sword dance?
You'll need to get out the way, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. Ha ha ha.
I always feel like getting the old {LF}sword out when I've got a lot of {LF}space around me.
Take a look at this sword. {LF}See that deep, beautiful shine? {LF}Oh, I just love it.
Take a look at this sword. That {LF}supple form. No excess. Not {LF}many people have got an eye {LF}for these things like me.
Look at this sword...such a {LF}magnificent shine. It could cut {LF}anything. It's got a coldness {LF}to it like the dead of winter.
I wonder if there aren't any good {LF}swords to be found out there. {LF}Probably not.
This heat's nothing compared to the {LF}sweltering heat you get when you're {LF}forging a sword.
Autumn certainly is the time for {LF}gathering swords.
A snowman might just be the perfect {LF}test for a new blade...
You come for a bath too? The baths {LF}here are really nice. They completely {LF}refresh you.
You come for a bath too? Imagine that.
You can't take a weapon with you into {LF}the bath, ha ha ha.
Julia's baths are always just the thing {LF}I need. 
It's nice to have a warm soak in the {LF}winter.
I'll need to head home before I catch {LF}cold.
I came to talk.
I came to buy.
Never mind.
Even you kids should have a weapon {LF}or two on you, just in case!
Your mom might get mad at me{LF}for saying that, though.
Roy says he doesn't need any {LF}weapons.
That's not what you'd say, is it?
Why isn't anyone interested in {LF}swords? It's so weird.
What are you looking for in a sword? {LF}Looks? Performance? Weight? The {LF}more specific you are, the more you'll {LF}see what each sword has to offer.
Oh, I see.
Hey, hands off the collection. Even {LF}Roy doesn't get to touch it. They're {LF}my pride and joy.
Don't touch my collection. You'll get {LF}your fingerprints all over it.
You interested in seeing all the {LF}weapons I've collected {LF}over the years?
You're free to look any time, but {LF}no touching.
Oh, you come to marvel at my {LF}collection? I do hope someday you'll {LF}come to appreciate all the beauty in {LF}swords.
How's your technique coming {LF}along? Keep practicing and you'll be {LF}a fine swordsman someday.
Don't go venturing into any dungeons {LF}without the right technique.
Roy seems to be spending time in {LF}dungeons lately. I wonder what {LF}he's doing there?
Look at how strong you're becoming. {LF}Kids grow up so fast these days.
Well, you look pleased with yourself. {LF}Have you been up to something?
You must very be happy your dad's {LF}returned, ＠アルス＠＠! You share a{LF}striking resemblance to him, you{LF}know.
There's not much money to be made {LF}selling weapons when the {LF}country's at peace.
There's not much money to be made {LF}selling weapons when the {LF}country's at peace.
Do you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}take Roy to be your{LF}husband, to have and to{LF}hold, from this day forward...
...For better, for worse, for richer,{LF}for poorer, in sickness and in health,{LF}to love and to cherish, till death{LF}do you part?
Umm... I... I...
Umm... I... I...
Ga ha ha ha! You can't make vows {LF}at your age!
Come on, ＠アルス＠＠! Just go along {LF}with it! We're only pretending!
Pretending?
Oh, sorry! Okay, I'll do it right!
Okay, let's swear our eternal love{LF}to each other!
You surprised me there. Ha ha ha.
Eternal love?
Kids and their games these days!{LF}Ga ha ha ha!
I'll love you forever and ever, {LF}＠アルス＠＠! Now you say the same {LF}thing to me!
What are you guys doing...
Okay! I promise to love you too!{LF}Forever and ever!
That's it, then! Now, off you two{LF}go to live happily ever after!{LF}Ga ha ha ha!
Thanks for helping out, Gordon!
Boy, I wonder if I'll ever get married{LF}for real someday...
Anyway, that was fun, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Let's play again sometime!
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
You brought this for me, huh? Now I {LF}don't have an excuse to yell at ya! {LF}Thanks!
You're a lifesaver, ＠カイル＠＠. Here, {LF}take this in return.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Ha ha ha. "Lifesaver"? I don't know {LF}about that, Roy.
Are you kidding? My mom is{LF}terrifying when she's mad!
You're carrying too much, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Get rid of something first.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
I knew you'd come through for me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thanks for keeping Mom from{LF}destroying me with her wrath!
You're my hero, ＠カイル＠＠. You {LF}deserve something in return. Here {LF}you go.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Be careful the next time you're{LF}playing!
Heh heh heh. I'll try!
You're carrying too much, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}Get rid of something first.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hey, you found an ＠アイテム９＠? {LF}Boy, I'm glad I asked you!
I'll make you a good-luck charm.
I'll just put this in there...
Ta-da! There we go, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}A ＠アイテム８＠.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, Roy.
Heh heh heh, I owed you. You ever {LF}need anything, you just let me know, {LF}okay?
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Whoops, your backpack's full, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Nothing else's gonna fit in {LF}there.
Returned ＠アイテム９＠.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
All right! A ＠アイテム９＠!
Wait till Cammy sees this! This'll {LF}show her!
I knew I could count on you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Here, take this. It's the least I can do.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, Roy.
Heh heh heh, you're always helping {LF}me out.
You're carrying too much, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}I can't give this to you if you don't get {LF}rid of something first.
This for me? Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, you found it!
That's it!
Boy, I sure owe you one, ＠アルス＠＠!
Here, have this in return!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Remember not to say anything to Leonel!{LF}Anyway, see ya!
You're carrying to much, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You'll need to get rid of something.
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
You brought it! Thanks!
I'd better drink this and{LF}get right down to studying!
I wish I had as much concentration as {LF}you, ＠アルス＠＠. You're always juggling{LF}a dozen things at once!
I hope someday I can be more like{LF}you...
Here, take this in return.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Heh, I did a little studying {LF}and made it myself!
Oh, you're carrying too much. {LF}You'll have to get rid of{LF}something in your backpack.
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
What's this for, ＠アルス＠＠?
Leonel asked me to give them to you. {LF}You were going to borrow them from him, {LF}right?
Leonel asked me to give them to you. {LF}You were going to borrow them from him, {LF}right?
Oh yeah, that's right! I'd completely {LF}forgotten! Thanks!
Be sure to thank Leonel for me,{LF}okay?
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, a ＠アイテム９＠! What's this{LF}for, ＠アルス＠＠?
Gordon asked me to give it to you.
Gordon asked me to give it to you.
Oh, that's right! I asked him for{LF}one of these a few days ago! Thanks!
Wow, this is just great! Be sure to{LF}thank Gordon for me, okay?
This for me? Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Yay! I love ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks a bunch!
Yay! You remembered I like this!{LF}Thanks!
Yay! You remembered I like this!{LF}Thanks!
Yay! You remembered I like this!{LF}Thanks!
Yikes! Oh man, I just hate ＠アイテム７＠!
You trying to make me angry?
I just love ＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks a bunch.
You remembered I like these! Thanks!
You remembered I like these! Thanks!
You remembered I like this! Thanks!
Yikes! Oh man, I just hate ＠アイテム７＠!
You trying to make me angry?
See how you like this, Roy.
What's this? It's okay to drink it?
Heh heh heh, you're a funny guy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Thanks.
Have a drink of this.
Have a drink of this.
What's this? It's okay to drink it?

Have a drink of this.
What's this? It's okay to drink it?
Whenever you look at me, I feel all {LF}warm inside and stuff, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}Wonder why.
Heh heh heh, that's my favorite. {LF}Maybe someone will give it to me for {LF}my birthday...?

What this square needs is some{LF}playground equipment! Maybe{LF}someone'll help brighten the{LF}place up one of these days...
See the fountain in the middle there? {LF}One time I jumped in there. Mom got {LF}so angry at me she hit me.
What a stick-in-the-mud.

Heh heh heh, let's go for a swim at {LF}the pool, ＠カイル＠＠!
Be sure to wash up before you get in, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. Don't want your dirt {LF}floating all over the place. And I get {LF}to go in first!

Welcome, weeelcome! Can you {LF}believe it? I actually get to run the {LF}store!
Welcome, weeelcome! I'm helping out {LF}with the store right now.
I'd rather be outside playing than {LF}doing this.
Welcome, weeelcome! I'm helping out  {LF}with the store right now. It's really{LF}lame. I don't have time for this.
Welcome, weeelcome! I'm running {LF}the store right now. If I leave my {LF}post, Mom'll get angry at me.
You seen my room? I got all sorts {LF}of treasure in there.
You seen my room? That's where I {LF}keep bugs I've caught.
You seen my room? I've got some {LF}fish in there.
You seen my room? My pet frog's {LF}hibernating for the winter in there.
Cammy's house is a lot bigger than {LF}mine. Lucky devil.
I always go over to Cammy's to {LF}play, since her house is nice and big.
Cammy! You still haven't given me {LF}back my bug cage!
I'm so jealous. Look at how big her {LF}house it.
Hey, who're you?
Hey there! My name's ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}What's yours?
I'm Roy. Where are you from?
Actually, I don't know myself...
Heh, what kinda answer's that? You {LF}have amnesia or something?
That's a big word for someone your {LF}age...
Well, you know... I pick up what I hear.
I'm tending to Mana's farm at the {LF}moment.
That dried out piece of junk? Good {LF}luck growing anything there!
I know it won't be easy. But I{LF}kinda like the challenge...
That's why I figure I'll be staying{LF}around here for a while...{LF}Guess I'll be seeing you around!
Well, if you ever have any questions {LF}about anything, you can always talk {LF}to me!
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

Today's the Flower Festival, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I ever tell you I climbed all {LF}the trees in town before?
Wow, that's incredible. Just don't do {LF}any of that today. The whole town'll {LF}get mad at you, ha ha ha.
Today's the Flower Festival. The {LF}cherry blossoms are really pretty, {LF}huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, they sure are. I like 'em too. {LF}Say, Roy...
Wanna go look at them with me?
Don't climb any trees today, okay?
Let's go look at them together. The {LF}trees at {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}looked nice.
Let's go look at them together. The {LF}trees at {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}looked nice.
Go look at the blossoms, you say? {LF}Sure!
Okay, well, you go on ahead to {LF}＠マップ９＠. {LF}I'll be right behind you.
I won't, I won't. I know how mad {LF}everyone'd get.
Mom always gets drunk for this. {LF}She's so embarrassing sometimes.
You go on ahead to{LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll be there in a jiff.
I had fun looking at the blossoms.
Today's the Flower Festival. Can't say {LF}I have much interest in staring at a {LF}bunch of flowers.
Today's the Eating Contest, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'd like to enter it myself.
Mom tells me I'd only end up {LF}with a sore stomach.
Wow, that was amazing, ＠カイル＠＠! {LF}I'm so jealous that you got to{LF}compete.
Guess that's just not your thing, huh, {LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Today's the Eating Contest. I'd like to {LF}enter it myself.
Mom tells me I'll only end up {LF}with a sore stomach.
That was incredible, ＠アルス＠＠! How {LF}in the world can you eat so fast? 
Guess that's just not your thing, huh, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
It's the 1st day of summer!{LF}I'm gonna go swimming today!
You don't waste any time, do you, {LF}Roy? Just make sure you're careful.

Today's the Monster Taming Contest. {LF}You aren't afraid of monsters, ＠アルス＠＠?
That was great, ＠アルス＠＠! I had no {LF}idea you were so good with monsters.
Monsters aren't your thing, huh, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Dance Festival. I ever tell {LF}you I love dancing?
Today's the Dance Festival. It's fun {LF}moving your body around. Are you {LF}gonna dance, ＠アルス＠＠?
Dance with me.
Maybe I'll dance in a bit.
You wanna dance with me? Sure, {LF}we can dance together.
Sorry, I'm actually kinda busy.
If you change your mind, we can {LF}still dance together later.
You're good at dancing, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}I had fun.
Sorry, I'm actually kinda busy.
Dancing's real fun.
Today's the Dance Festival. I love to {LF}dance.
Today's the Fishing Contest. {LF}Fishing's so boring. I'm no good at it.
Wow, you're really good at fishing, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Maybe you shouldn't have entered, {LF}huh?
Today's the Big Cook-Off. You ever {LF}cook, ＠アルス＠＠?
You can really cook, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}I was impressed.
You don't seem that good at cooking. {LF}You don't have to enter something if {LF}you don't think you're up to it, you {LF}know.
Today's the Adventure Contest. This {LF}is my event!
Ha ha, yeah, you love your {LF}adventures, Roy.
I know shortcuts nobody else knows. {LF}You won't get anything outta me, {LF}though!
That was incredible, ＠カイル＠＠! We {LF}should go out exploring sometime!
Too bad. I'll show you how it's done {LF}sometime.
There's the Adventure Contest today. {LF}I like to think I'm pretty good at that {LF}sorta thing.

You didn't do too well, huh? Maybe I {LF}could give you a few pointers {LF}sometime.
Today's the Harvest Festival. I've {LF}been chowing down on all those {LF}vegetables you've given us, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!

Today's the Monster Contest. I'd like {LF}to see what kinda monsters you've {LF}got up your sleeve, ＠カイル＠＠.
I can't believe the monsters {LF}you've got working for you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
That wasn't really as exciting as I {LF}was expecting.
Today's the Monster Contest! I {LF}wonder if we'll see any nice ones?
That was amazing, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. I'm all jealous.
That wasn't very exciting, I gotta say.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}Did you know they're actually these {LF}things called meteors?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}The shooting stars are always so{LF}beautiful.
Let's go watch them together!
I probably can't stay up that late...
You wanna go look at them with me? {LF}Sure, we can go together.
All right, let's meet up at Falling{LF}Star Path at 9 o'clock tonight.
Sorry, I'm actually kinda busy.
I actually tend to fall asleep right{LF}when it gets dark!
Let's meet up at Falling Star Path{LF}at 9 o'clock tonight, ＠アルス＠＠.
I hope we get to see some shooting{LF}stars!
Well, there's always next year.
I never thought we'd see as many as {LF}that. I had fun, ＠アルス＠＠.
Have you ever seen a shooting star,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival. {LF}I know what the stars really are. {LF}These things called meteors.
Today's the Mining Contest. I know {LF}this shortcut into the caves nobody {LF}else knows about!
You won't get it outta me, ＠カイル＠＠!
That was incredible, ＠カイル＠＠! You {LF}didn't even use my shortcut!
Heh heh heh, if only you'd known my {LF}shortcut, huh?
Heh heh heh, bet nobody thought I'd {LF}win, huh?
Today's the Mining Contest. Digging {LF}for ores is actually pretty tough.
Wow, I can't believe you won, {LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Didn't go so well, did it? Maybe I can {LF}give you a few pointers sometime.
Today's New Year's Eve. Next year I {LF}wanna go explore places I've never been.
Today's New Year's Eve. There's so {LF}many things I didn't get to do this year...
Thanks! Just remember not to tell {LF}Leonel!
Thanks again, ＠アルス＠＠!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Heh heh heh.
Thanks! Just be sure and don't tell {LF}Mom.
Now she won't get mad at me.
Heh heh heh, see, I'm not all trouble, {LF}am I? 
This'll show that Cammy.
Hey Roy. I'm out patrolling the {LF}town at the moment. Anything {LF}going on?
No, can't say that there is.{LF}Wow, a patrol! That's so cool!
You read the bulletin board, ＠カイル＠＠?
There's something I wanted to ask {LF}you. Will you hear me out?
I was horsing around the house  {LF}when I ripped the ＠アイテム９＠  {LF}on the kitchen table.
If Mom finds out it's torn, they'll {LF}never find my body.
Think you could help me out? You're {LF}the only hope I've got, ＠カイル＠＠!
Guess I don't have much choice. {LF}I'll help you out, but I think you should {LF}apologize to your mom.
Thanks! So, it's a ＠アイテム９＠.
I heard the ＠モンスター９＠s in {LF}Trieste Forest drop it. Just find{LF}the ones wielding maces.{LF}Piece of cake, right?
Thanks! I'll be waiting for ya.
I bet you will.
So, I need a ＠アイテム９＠.
I heard the ＠モンスター９＠s in {LF}Trieste Forest drop it. Just find{LF}the ones wielding maces.{LF}Piece of cake, right?
You read the bulletin board, ＠カイル＠＠?
I've got something else I wanna ask {LF}you.
I was horsing around the house  {LF}when I broke the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}decoration on the kitchen shelf!
If Mom finds out it's broken, she'll {LF}throw me out of the house!
You gotta help me, ＠カイル＠＠!
I need to replace it before Mom {LF}notices it's broken.
For crying out loud, you broke {LF}something else? I wish you'd learn to {LF}control that energy of yours, Roy.
Heh heh heh. Sorry. I try to be {LF}careful. Honest!
I wonder...
I swear I do! Please, ＠カイル＠＠. {LF}You gotta bail me out!
All right, all right. So where can I{LF}find another ＠アイテム９＠?
Awesome! I knew you wouldn't let my{LF}mom kill me! {LF}Let's see, a ＠アイテム９＠...
That's right, the ＠モンスター９＠{LF}carries it. You'll find that monster at {LF}Padova Mts. - Crossroad.
I could never take it on by myself.{LF}Thanks a million!
Wow, thanks again, ＠カイル＠＠!
So, it's a ＠アイテム９＠.
You should be able to get it from {LF}＠モンスター９＠. I could never manage {LF}it myself. That's why I need your help, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
＠カイル＠＠! Just the guy {LF}I wanted to see!
What did you break this time, Roy?
Heh heh heh, you haven't even given {LF}me a chance to speak!
You carry around a good-luck charm {LF}or anything, ＠カイル＠＠?
Mom was telling me about them.
If you have a good-luck charm {LF}with you,
it'll protect you when {LF}you're in trouble.
If I had an ＠アイテム９＠, I could make {LF}one, no problem.
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind {LF}looking for one for me?
A good-luck charm? That doesn't {LF}seem like you, Roy.
What, can't a guy do something nice {LF}every now and then?
If you bring me the goods, I could {LF}make one for you, ＠カイル＠＠.
So go find an ＠アイテム９＠ for me, {LF}will you?
You can find them in Trieste Forest.
All right, I'll be back.
You should be able to find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ by smashing rocks over{LF}at Trieste Forest. Thanks, buddy!
Hey, you've come at the perfect time, {LF}＠カイル＠＠!
I have a request I wanted to make.
What do you need?
I'd like it if you could go get me a {LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Cammy's got one, and she keeps {LF}rubbing it in my face!
I wanna get one for myself and give {LF}her a taste of her own medicine!
So you think you could find a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me?
All right, I'll go get one.
Awesome! I'll be waiting for you!
You can find a ＠アイテム９＠ at {LF}Blessia Island.
I want it so bad!
There you are, ＠アルス＠＠! I have {LF}something I wanted to ask you!
Uh... I seem to have lost the {LF}＠アイテム９＠ I borrowed from{LF}Leonel...
I can't find the thing anywhere!
He's a nice guy and probably wouldn't {LF}get mad about it, but I'm sure it'd {LF}make him sad if he found out I lost{LF}it...
Will you help me look for it, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Sure. Where'd you lose it?
Sure. Where'd you lose it?
I think somewhere in my house.
It could be somewhere with Mom's {LF}weapons, or buried under my toys.
But, in any case, I can't find it{LF}at all! Will you help me look for{LF}it?
Sure, I'll give the place a good {LF}looking over!
Sure, I'll give the place a good {LF}looking over!
You find the ＠アイテム９＠ yet?
I'm sure it's somewhere in my{LF}house!
Press the A Button to search {LF}anywhere you think it might be!{LF}Thanks!
What's up, ＠アルス＠＠?
I read your message on the bulletin{LF}board.
I read your message on the bulletin{LF}board.
Ah, then you know I need your help! {LF}Could you go talk to my mom for me?
She wants me to take over the family{LF}business for her, but I haven't decided {LF}what I wanna do when I'm older yet.
She keeps going on to me about it. {LF}Could you tell her I don't know if I {LF}want to take over the business when I {LF}grow up?
I see. Yeah, it must be hard for you. {LF}Okay, I'll go talk to her!
I see. Yeah, it must be hard for you. {LF}Okay, I'll go talk to her!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Go tell my mom that I don't know if I{LF}want to take over the business for her.
I really appreciate it, ＠アルス＠＠!
Well, I talked to your mom, Roy.
Well, I talked to your mom, Roy.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}So, what did she say?
She said she didn't know you felt{LF}that way. She'll stop talking to{LF}you about it for now.
She said she didn't know you felt{LF}that way. She'll stop talking to{LF}you about it for now.
Really? Great! Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
I've got to thank you for this!{LF}Here's a little something!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thanks!
You can't carry anything more{LF}You need to make some room in{LF}your backpack!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠, do you have some{LF}free time? I've got a problem I{LF}need a hand with.
I've been, well...starting to have{LF}trouble understanding the lessons in {LF}school...
It didn't bother me at first, but I've{LF}started to think that I need to study{LF}harder.
But that's where my problem comes in...{LF}Every time I try to study, I just can't {LF}concentrate.
I heard that ＠アイテム７＠ is great{LF}for improving concentration.
So, could you bring me some ＠アイテム７＠,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
＠アイテム７＠...? It's not hard to make,{LF}Roy... They've taught us about it in{LF}school, so I think you could make it{LF}yourself...
＠アイテム７＠...? It's not hard to make,{LF}Roy... They've taught us about it in{LF}school, so I think you could make it{LF}yourself...
But I can't remember it right now!{LF}Please, ＠アルス＠＠, I could really{LF}use your help!
This is hardly a good start to your{LF}studies, Roy! Oh, okay, I'll help{LF}you out.
This is hardly a good start to your{LF}studies, Roy! Oh, okay, I'll help{LF}you out.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠! Here's what you'll{LF}need to make it!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks in advance, ＠アルス＠＠!
Oh, your backpack is full. You'd better{LF}take something out first, okay?
Please, bring me some ＠アイテム７＠!
Thanks in advance!
I saw your post on the bulletin board!
I saw your post on the bulletin board!
Oh, hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Keep it down, okay?
Huh? What's wrong?
Huh? What's wrong?
I did put it up on the board, but{LF}I want to keep this a secret, at {LF}much as possible.
A secret...?
A secret...?
A secret, yes. Let me explain...
I want to sneak into school tonight!
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?{LF}You'll come too, right, ＠アルス＠＠?
Uh... What if we get caught?
Uh... What if we get caught?
Ha! You scared, ＠アルス＠＠?
No! Of course I'm not scared!{LF}Fine, count me in!
No! Of course I'm not scared!{LF}Fine, count me in!
Great! I knew I could count on you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Is anyone else coming with us?
Is anyone else coming with us?
Cammy wanted to, but it doesn't{LF}look like she can come tonight...
So it's just me and you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Okay!
Okay!
Don't go getting scared now that{LF}you know it's going to be just{LF}you and me!
Of course not!
Of course not!
All right, then! We'll meet at 9 PM{LF}tonight outside the school! Remember{LF}to come, ＠アルス＠＠!
We'll meet at 9 PM tonight outside{LF}the school! Don't forget to come,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠!
I saw the bulletin board.{LF}What did you want to talk about?
Heh heh, about that...
There's something I wanted to tell you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
What's that?
I like you, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I mean...really like you.
And I was wondering...how you feel {LF}about me, ＠アルス＠＠.
That's...quite sudden!{LF}Um, well...
I like you too.
I like you as a friend, Roy.
I...like you too, Roy...!
Tee-hee... It's a little embarrassing{LF}to say it out loud...!
Heh, yeah, I know! I'm glad to hear{LF}you say that, though! All right,{LF}＠アルス＠＠! Let's get married!
Huh...?
Let's head for the chapel!
I like you Roy, but as a friend...
I see... Well, it was worth a shot!
Anyway... I'm glad I'm friends with{LF}you, ＠アルス＠＠...
Thanks! Me too!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, what's up?
Roy, Natalie is looking for you.{LF}You're hiding from your shot?
I'm not hiding, okay?! I'm just...{LF}putting a little distance between me and {LF}the needle.
That's that same thing.
Shots hurt, okay?{LF}You understand what I mean,{LF}right, ＠カイル＠＠?
I do, but still. A man doesn't hide{LF}from anything. Cammy will laugh if{LF}she hears about this!
Okay, okay! I'll go, I'll go!
Good. Make sure you do, then!
I will.
I'll go and see Natalie, right away!{LF}You can trust me!
It's finally warming up again.{LF}I love to take it easy in spring time.
It's the Flower Festival tomorrow. I{LF}know the best place! But it's a secret!
Are you okay, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}That was quite an earthquake.{LF}It was pretty exciting!
It's the Eating Contest tomorrow!{LF}I'm going to try and compete, even{LF}though my mom is against it.
Summer starts tomorrow! I'm gonna get{LF}some serious fishing done!{LF}Let's go swimming, too, ＠カイル＠＠!
It's the Monster Taming Contest{LF}tomorrow. I'd love to take part...{LF}Can I be your assistant, ＠カイル＠＠?
Another earthquake! I'm fine, of course.{LF}It knocked down a bunch of stuff in the shop,{LF}though, so my mom got really angry at it!
It's been so hot recently! There's this{LF}cool spot in the caves that I know {LF}about, though. Of course, only I know {LF}about it.
It's the Dance Festival tomorrow. I'm a{LF}pretty good dancer, actually, thanks to {LF}Mom making me practice my weapons{LF}footwork all the time.
Have you heard about the Fishing{LF}Contest? I don't like fishing. You{LF}have to stand really still and be{LF}really quiet. It's soooo boring!
It's the Adventure Contest tomorrow.{LF}That sounds awesome! I really want{LF}to participate!
Another quake! I was surprised...by{LF}Mom's screaming, of course. Heh heh.
It's the Harvest Festival tomorrow.{LF}Do you want me to come and lend you a{LF}hand bringing in your produce,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
The heat is finally fading. I love fall{LF}because the food is always so good!
It's the Monster Contest tomorrow.{LF}I'd love to use a monster too! But I{LF}guess I need to catch one first...
It's the Shooting Star Festival{LF}tomorrow. I know what shooting stars {LF}are! They're called meteors!
You look cold, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I'm fine, of course.
Impressive!{LF}You're one toasty little kid!
Well, I am always working out!
It's the Mining Contest tomorrow.{LF}Using a hammer, right?{LF}That sounds pretty...heavy.
Yeah. You do need some strength.{LF}I'm not so good at it myself...
I see. When maybe I can get in too...?
There have sure been a lot of {LF}earthquakes recently! {LF}Mom's screaming is the {LF}worst part, though.
Tomorrow is the end of this year!{LF}Another fun year coming to a close! Next {LF}year should be even more fun!
Why do you think spring makes you so{LF}sleepy...? Especially during lessons. {LF}Still, I like spring the best!
Summer means the beach and the sea!{LF}I knew it, I like summer the best!
The food is always good in fall!{LF}Yep, I like fall the best!
There's no beating a snowball fight in{LF}winter! I like winter the best, for {LF}sure!
Are you going to live here forever,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Say, ＠カイル＠＠...have you tilled{LF}your entire field yet? I'd better{LF}go and dig up the stuff I hid out{LF}there!
I've spent quite a lot of time playing {LF}in that field, actually. But I don't {LF}mind you taking it over. Just make lots {LF}of tasty veggies, okay?
I'm always at my best in the morning!{LF}How about you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Heh heh, what can I play at today?
Heh heh, what can I play at tomorrow?
I like to eat ＠アイテム９＠ dishes.
What do you think, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You like them too?
I like to eat a ＠アイテム９＠.
What do you think, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You like them too?
I like to eat a ＠アイテム９＠.
What do you think, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}You like them too?
Come on, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}play with me!
If you've got some time,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, let's play!
Have you got any plans for tomorrow,{LF}＠カイル＠＠? If not...{LF}I know some games we could play.
Where did you come from, ＠カイル＠＠?
I don't know. I've lost my memory...
You don't remember... Well, don't worry!{LF}I'm good at forgetting things too! {LF}Like... when Mom gets angry with me!
Heh heh heh.
Where were you before you came here,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I don't know. I've lost my memory...
You don't remember... A totally{LF}different world, maybe...?
Where did you come from, ＠カイル＠＠?
I don't know. I've lost my memory...
You don't remember... Well, don't worry!{LF}I'm good at forgetting things too! {LF}Like...when Mom gets angry with me!
I found a really beautiful crystal deep{LF}in the caves.
I'll show you if you like,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
The caves are dangerous, though, so it{LF}could be risky...!
If Mom finds out I'll get chewed out{LF}again, so let's keep this secret!
I found a really beautiful crystal deep{LF}in the caves.

The caves are dangerous, though, so it{LF}could be risky...!
So don't tell my mom! She'll be furious!

I'm collecting ＠アイテム８＠{LF}at the moment.
If you get your hands on some, please{LF}give them to me ＠カイル＠＠.

I really like your clothes,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You do? Well, I guess they are a style{LF}you don't see around here that much...
I'm sure you come from somewhere far{LF}away from here, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Your clothes are proof!
This necklace of mine was actually made{LF}by my mom.
Oh, it's nice, too! You'd better take{LF}good care of it!
Yeah, you're right. Not in the least{LF}'cos she'll get mad if I lose it!
This necklace of mine was actually made{LF}by my mom.
Oh, it's nice, too! You'd better take{LF}good care of it!
I did lose it once, and boy. I searched{LF}like crazy to find it before Mom {LF}realized!
Before you came, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I actually hid some treasures of mine in {LF}the fields here.
When I heard you had started tilling I{LF}dashed over here to recover them!

There's one thing I really don't like.{LF}I can't stand ＠アイテム７＠.{LF}I just don't understand how people think{LF}it tastes any good at all.

When's your birthday, ＠カイル＠＠?
I don't remember that, either...
Of course. Well, you can remember mine{LF}instead, if you like! It's the 25th of {LF}Winter. 
When's your birthday, ＠カイル＠＠?
I don't remember that, either...
Of course. Well, you can remember mine{LF}instead, if you like! It's the 25th of {LF}Winter. 
My birthday is the 25th of Winter.{LF}Remember it!
I know, I know.{LF}You want a present, don't you?
Was it that obvious? Well, now you know.{LF}I'll look forward to your gift.
What do you think about me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You're a lively kid
Nothing much
Heh heh, that's right!
What? I've not made any impression on{LF}you at all? That sucks.
What do you think about me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You're a lively kid
Nothing much
Heh heh, you've got me down perfectly!
What? I've not made any impression on{LF}you at all? That sucks.
What do you think about me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
You're a lively kid
You need to calm down a little
Heh heh, you've got me down perfectly!
What?! I can be calm and peaceful,{LF}at times, you'll see!
Say, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you found anything out in the {LF}fields?
Like...what? I haven't see anything{LF}yet...
Okay. I actually buried some toys and{LF}stuff out there a while back.
Ah ha ha, I guess it would be a surprise {LF}to turn up something like that!

Okay...so I wonder where all the toys{LF}I buried are...?
Ah ha ha, I guess it would be a surprise {LF}to turn up something like that!
There's something I've been keeping{LF}secret from my mom, actually...
I just happened to touch a piece in her{LF}collection and something broke off! I'm {LF}too scared to tell her.
I see...well, so long as you explain{LF}everything, I don't think she'll be mad.
Really...? I'm not sure about that... {LF}you do know my mom, right?
There's something I've been keeping{LF}secret from my mom, actually...
I just happened to touch a piece in her{LF}collection and something broke off! I'm {LF}too scared to tell her.
Even if you keep quiet, the truth will {LF}come out eventually. You'd be better off {LF}to just own up now.
Maybe...but I'm scared to!

I'm not a morning person.{LF}I hate waking up early!

Do you have a dream for the future,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
I don't mind working in the fields, but{LF}I haven't decided anything more than {LF}that, for now.
Really? I had you pegged as a farmer{LF}for life, to be honest.

Tell me your dreams for the future,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I don't mind working in the fields, but{LF}I haven't decided anything more than {LF}that, for now.
Really? I had you pegged as a farmer{LF}for life, to be honest. I haven't{LF}decided anything myself either, yet.
My mom is a bit odd, isn't she?{LF}Why does she love swords so much,{LF}do you think?
My mom is a bit odd, isn't she?
She may look normal at first glance, but {LF}as soon as someone mentions swords her {LF}eyes...change.
My mom is a bit odd, isn't she?
Even I'm not allowed to touch her prized {LF}collection. If I do - and I do, {LF}sometimes - she gets so mad, boy.
I'd just finished my secret base,{LF}and a storm blew it all away!
It took ages to get everything just{LF}right, too...
That's a shame. Where did you build it?
Heh heh, I'm not telling you!{LF}That's my secret, and my secret alone!
I'd just finished my secret base,{LF}and a storm blew it all away!
It took ages to get everything just{LF}right, too...
That's a shame.{LF}Are you going to build another one?
Ah ha! I think you'll find construction{LF}has already started! But don't tell{LF}anyone!
I'd just finished my secret base,{LF}and a storm blew it all away!
It took ages to get{LF}everything just right, too...
That's a shame. Just what is your secret{LF}base, anyway?
My own private fort. It's got{LF}everything, the perfect place to relax. {LF}Guess I need to get started on another {LF}one...
Hadn't you better start thinking about{LF}marriage, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? Where did that come from, Roy?
That's just what my mom said.{LF}I don't know anything about stuff{LF}like that.
I wonder if I'll ever get married?{LF}You know, in the future.
Hadn't you better start thinking about{LF}marriage, ＠カイル＠＠?
Where did that come from, Roy?
That's just what my mom said.{LF}I don't care.
I can see you being a henpecked husband,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I really can!{LF}Hah hah, you'd better be careful who you{LF}marry!
Hadn't you better start thinking about{LF}marriage, ＠カイル＠＠?
I never thought I'd hear you say that,{LF}Roy!
That's just what my mom said. I've never{LF}thought about marriage, myself.
To think, you're getting married,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! I guess anything{LF}can happen, after all.
I don't like reading much, to be honest.
Really, why not?
I'm always too busy wondering what's{LF}going on outside to concentrate on some {LF}dumb book.
Do you like books, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm always too busy wondering what's{LF}going on outside to concentrate on some {LF}dumb book.

Do you know the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
A whole pile of monsters live there, I {LF}heard. I'd love to explore it!
Do you know the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
It's my dream to explore it.{LF}All sorts of monsters live there.
Do you know the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
It's my dream to explore it. Doesn't{LF}hearing that a place is scary just make {LF}you want to go there all the more?
I love this town. There's so many places{LF}to play! I used to play out in your {LF}fields a lot, too, ＠カイル＠＠.
Well, just don't damage my crops if you{LF}go out there now!
I love this town. There's so many places{LF}to play! I used to play out in your {LF}fields a lot, too, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'd really love to know how you amused{LF}yourself out there...
Where can I play today? I think I've{LF}grown out of playing in your fields,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Well, just don't damage my crops if you{LF}go out there now!
Please, ＠カイル＠＠, can you stop{LF}growing vegetables that I don't like?{LF}Mom force feeds them to me!
Ah ha ha, sorry Roy, I can't do that.
You've got something against me,{LF}haven't you, ＠カイル＠＠!
I do like to play in the earth, digging{LF}and whatever. You think I'd make a good {LF}farmer?
Sure. Maybe better than me!
Heh heh, I guess I'll work the fields{LF}if I ever need a job, then.
I do like to play in the earth, digging{LF}and whatever. You think I'd make a good {LF}farmer?
Sure. Maybe better than me!
Heh heh, I don't know about that.{LF}I don't think I need to become a farmer {LF}with you around, ＠カイル＠＠.
Have you heard how strong the Elder{LF}Dragons are? I don't think anyone could {LF}beat one alone!
I know, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Let's take the Elder Dragon on {LF}together! The two of us!
Ah ha ha, you really want to take it on, {LF}don't you?!
Have you heard how strong the Elder{LF}Dragon is? I don't think anyone could {LF}beat that thing alone!
I know, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Let's take the Elder Dragon on {LF}together! The two of us!
Ah ha ha! I'm not sure even the two{LF}of us would want to take it on, Roy!
Have you heard how strong the Elder{LF}Dragon is? I don't think anyone could {LF}beat that thing alone!
I know, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Let's take the Elder Dragon on {LF}together! The two of us!
Ah ha ha, I think it would take more {LF}than just two people!
You're like a real brother to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm honored that you think so.
I'm an only child, so it feels good to{LF}finally have a big brother!
You're like a real brother to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm honored that you think so.
Heh heh, let's play together sometime{LF}soon, ＠カイル＠＠!
You're like a real brother to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm honored that you think so.
So...if Mom ever gets angry with me,{LF}you'll come to my rescue, right brother?
Your dad can do anything,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. He's a really{LF}clever guy. He always helped me{LF}out when I needed him, too.
Where do you think he's gone?
 ＠アイテム６＠ tastes wonderful,{LF}doesn't it. I really wish I could eat{LF}one, right now!
I like ＠アイテム５＠ for desert.
Do you like coming to school,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? I do. I mean,{LF}it's great fun to see everyone else!
Of course, I don't understand the{LF}lessons!
Don't tell any of the adults about{LF}how you're going into the forests{LF}and caves, okay?
They'll put a stop to it if they find{LF}out...
It's fun talking to you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Mana is already in the classroom.
I wonder if I should tell you about my{LF}secret playing place, ＠アルス＠＠.
I much prefer playing here to studying{LF}lessons!
Do you check the bulletin board often?{LF}I sometimes post things, too. {LF}If you see one more {LF}mine, come find me!
You always look so busy, ＠アルス＠＠. {LF}You've got a lot to do, haven't you.
When I see Cammy minding her shop it{LF}always reminds me that I'm meant to be {LF}minding ours!
Heh heh heh, here to enjoy a bath,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
I don't need to remind you to wash{LF}before getting into the public bath, {LF}right?
After a nice hot bath, the best thing is{LF}to dash home before you cool down again!
Hey there! You here to buy something?{LF}I don't mean to boast, but my mom's {LF}weapons are super sharp.
Hey there! You here to buy something?{LF}I don't really have time to mind the {LF}shop, to be honest.
Hey there! You here to buy something?{LF}Mom asked me to mind the shop, so I {LF}can't play outside right now.
Hey there! You here to buy something?{LF}I'm not sure you'll be able to handle {LF}too big a sword yet, ＠アルス＠＠!
Ah ha, welcome to my lair!{LF}Now, shall we plan our next move?
Ah ha, welcome to my lair! I don't mind{LF}you coming in here, but don't mess {LF}things up! Mom will get mad!
You know...this place is actually{LF}pretty scary, isn't it. Swords {LF}everywhere!
Boy...Mom sure does love weapons.
Remember, don't touch Mom's collection{LF}of weapons!
It's dangerous! Mainly to me, though!{LF}If something were to break, she'd be{LF}furious!
Do you want to have some fun,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? I was just trying to{LF}decide what to do.
I want to live in a house like Cammy's.{LF}A nice, safe house, what doesn't have {LF}weapons everywhere!
They have that big, sparkling stained{LF}glass, too, don't they!
I want some of that in my room!
I'm sure Cammy's father used to be a{LF}fighter or something.
In spring, I'd rather be out in the{LF}woods than in here studying lessons.
Lessons are such a pain! Don't you think{LF}so too, ＠アルス＠＠?
Spring is the time for napping during{LF}lessons! Of course, if you get caught,{LF}you get chewed out.
There wasn't a school here until all{LF}that long ago. If only they had waited {LF}until I was a little older before they {LF}went and built it...!
Finally, another week of school{LF}finished! Is it me, or is each week {LF}taking longer and longer?
Can you follow all of these lessons,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? Quite a lot of it just{LF}goes right over my head, to be honest.
Let's head to the beach once school is{LF}out! Is that going to be soon?
Isn't there an easier way to learn all{LF}this stuff...?
Even when I do pay attention, I forget {LF}more than half by the time I get home.
I never want to study when it's hot.
You just never want to study.
You just never want to study.
Heh heh, there is that.
More lessons from today! I'd love school{LF}if there weren't any lessons!
Fall is for sports. Let's get outside{LF}and exercise!
Some people say fall is good for{LF}studying, too.
Some people say fall is good for{LF}studying, too.
Not me!
Why do you think your dad built a{LF}school, ＠アルス＠＠?
I don't think we needed one, to be{LF}honest...
I tried one of combinations we learnt,{LF}the other day...
But I couldn't get it to work.{LF}I guess I was missing something...
Orland is something else, isn't he.{LF}Boy, he studies hard.
Do you think the snow outside could be{LF}used in a workshop creation? {LF}There's so much of it, it's a shame for {LF}it to all go to waste.
I feel tired less than a minute after I{LF}sit at my desk. Why do you think that {LF}is? Is there a cure?
Do you think we'll have some sports {LF}lessons soon? I'm sure I'd do well at {LF}those.
Leonel is a pretty good student, too.{LF}I'm pretty jealous of the smart kids, I {LF}have to say!
It's so warm here in school, even in{LF}winter! It just makes me all the more {LF}sleepy.
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to play outside!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to play in the sea!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I'm so bored!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to make a snowman!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to play outside!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to play in the sea!

Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to make a snowman!
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to play outside!
There wasn't a school in town, before,{LF}was there. But your dad built this one, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
To be honest, I think we were better off {LF}without it.
Orland is one smart guy. I wish he could {LF}share some of those brains with me.
Oh, I can't stand any more lessons!{LF}I want to make a snowman!
Heh, you're here, just as you{LF}promised! All right... Let's go!
Just follow me, ＠アルス＠＠!
I made a secret passage so we can get{LF}inside!
Wow!
Wow!
All right, in we go!
Great, you're here, ＠アルス＠＠!
I hope we see some shooting stars!
Man, I'm so excited!
Me too!|
It's a little cold, but it should be{LF}worth it!
Ah! I saw one! Wow!
How beautiful...!|
Yeah, it was!
Wow, there's another one!
This is awesome! Man, you sure{LF}don't see this every day!
No, you don't!
Hey, Orland at school told me he knew{LF}what shooting stars actually are!{LF}He said they're actually giant{LF}rocks!
Really? Why would there be giant rocks{LF}flying in the sky?
Um, well... That I don't know,{LF}actually...
Hmmm... Seems mysterious...
I'll find out for you one day,{LF}don't worry!
Imagine what would happen if one of{LF}those things hit the earth! Kaboom!
That's kinda a scary thought!
You think? I'd love it! I bet it'd{LF}be really exciting!
Yeah, You do like stuff like that,{LF}don't you, Roy?
Heh, yeah, I guess so!
Anyway, I'm glad we were able spend{LF}some time together like this,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm glad too, Roy!
Heh, thanks!
Well, shall we head home?
Yeah...
Thanks for inviting me tonight,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. I had a great time.
Thank you, Roy. I had a great{LF}time, too.
Okay, see you soon, ＠アルス＠＠!
Yeah! See you later, Roy!
You took out that monster in the{LF}forest?! Wow, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I'm impressed!
You're stronger than you look,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
You've got stronger, to be able to take{LF}out that monster in the Messhina Valley. 
You're strong, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I hear you've been defeating monsters in {LF}the Padova Mountains ?
You're something else, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I never thought you'd achieve so much!
Wow...! ＠カイル＠＠ came back?!{LF}That's great, ＠アルス＠＠!
Anything interesting happening?
Anything interesting happening?
This is some medicine that I asked{LF}Natalie for. Thanks for bringing it to {LF}me. I wanted to take it as soon as {LF}possible.
Thank Natalie for me, will you? I'm sure{LF}I'll need her services again in the {LF}future, too. Oh, and thanks to you, too.
Oh? Is that for me? Thanks.
Oh? Is that for me? Well, Natalie has{LF}been helping me out, so sorry...but I {LF}don't need it right now.
Oh? Is that for me? Wow, this is great.{LF}Thanks.
(Ah...I have to give it to Julia first,{LF}don't I...)
(It would be faster to give it to him{LF}now, but I guess that can't be helped.)
Put ＠アイテム９＠ away.
Oh? Can I help you with something,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Ah... no, I'm fine, thanks.
Oh? Is that for me? This is great.{LF}Thanks.
Oh? Let me take a look at these{LF}documents... Ah! This crest...!{LF}Well well...
...
I see, I see.
She's got a plan, from the look of it.
Thanks for this, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Tell the sender I understand. 
Is that for me?{LF}Well, I can't turn down a gift.
Oh? Is that for me? This is great.{LF}Thanks.
This is for you, Mayor Byron.{LF}It's from Egan.
This is for you, Mayor Byron.{LF}It's from Egan.
Ah, you brought it here{LF}personally? Thank you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Ah yes, that smells great!{LF}Thank Egan for me, please.
I will!
I will!
Oh? Is that for me? This is great.{LF}Thanks.
Oh, is that for me? Wow, thanks.{LF}I do love ＠アイテム９＠.
Thank you. I'll look forward to eating{LF}it.
Ah, is that a ＠アイテム８＠?{LF}They make lovely decorations,{LF}don't you think?
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, I don't know about this... I don't{LF}really like the smell.
I don't know what I'd do with this,{LF}even if I took it from you.
Oh, is that for me? Wow, thanks.{LF}I do love ＠アイテム９＠.

Oh, I don't know about this... I don't{LF}really like the smell.
I don't know what I'd do with this,{LF}even if I took it from you.
Mayor Byron, please drink this.
Oh, what is it?
You're always a big help, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thank you.
Please, take this.
Please, take this.
Oh, what's this?
You've been a good friend to Leonel too,{LF}haven't you. Thank you.
Oh, this looks wonderful! What's brought{LF}this on? It isn't even my birthday! This {LF}would make the perfect birthday gift, {LF}though, wouldn't it! Hah hah hah!
Oh, this looks wonderful! What's brought {LF}this on? It isn't even my birthday! This {LF}would make the perfect birthday gift, {LF}though, wouldn't it! Hah hah hah!
Well, this is a coincidence! It's{LF}actually my birthday today! This is a {LF}great present. Thank you!
Well, this is a coincidence! It's{LF}actually my birthday today! This is a {LF}great present. Thank you!
A kind thought, but you've already given{LF}me more than enough. Thank you.
A kind thought, but you've already given{LF}me more than enough. Thank you.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is that for me?{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Is that for me?{LF}Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I want to talk to you.
I want to build a barn.
I want to talk to you.
I want to build a barn.
I want to build a school.
Everything seems well with the town{LF}at the moment. I'm glad.
It's summer, so of course it's hot!{LF}Complaining about it won't do any good, {LF}will it? Hah hah hah!
Ah, my favorite season. I'm looking{LF}forward to the produce from your fields, {LF}too!
The fields look bare and lonely in{LF}winter, don't they?
A barn? There's some space {LF}on the west of the farm that {LF}should suit your needs. {LF}You can use that, if you like.
Thank you.
You'll need 50 pieces of wood and{LF}5,000G to build it.
Th-That's a little more expensive than{LF}I was expecting...!
We are talking about an entire building{LF}here, after all! You have my permission {LF}to build it, anyway, so the rest is up {LF}to you.
Once you have the materials and the{LF}money, come back and talk to me again.
Ah, you have the required money and{LF}materials, I see. Do you want to go {LF}ahead with building the barn, then?
Yes
Let me think it over some more
Oh? Okay, well, if you {LF}change your mind{LF}then come and see me again.
I'll make arrangements for {LF}the barn to be built, {LF}then. It will be a four-story {LF}building.
Thank you.
I've got my best men standing by, so you{LF}should have your building by tomorrow {LF}morning.
Wow! That fast?
That fast. Look forward to it!
The barn will be {LF}finished for tomorrow{LF}morning. Look forward to it!
Although there is potential to {LF}expand the barn, {LF}I don't think we need to right now.
You don't have enough {LF}wood to build a barn. {LF}You need 50 pieces of lumber.
You don't have enough {LF}gold to build a barn. {LF}You need 5,000G.
A school! That's a pretty big{LF}proposition...
It's really important to me and{LF}my wife.
I see... Well, in a town of this{LF}size, children are normally taught{LF}at home...
But, Mayor, even if there are{LF}only a few children in this town,{LF}I still think it's important{LF}for them to all learn together.
Hmmm... That might be true, but{LF}have you considered the cost?{LF}Building a school would be very{LF}expensive!
I will pay for the cost of{LF}everything.
Oh, my! How altruistic of you!{LF}Very well, then! I'll provide{LF}Cherry Blossom Square as the land{LF}for the school to be built on!
Thank you very much, Mayor Byron!
To build the school, I'll need{LF}1000 pieces of wood and 100,000G.{LF}Are you still sure you want to do{LF}this?
I am. I'll get the{LF}materials...somehow.
A school... It's an exciting{LF}prospect, to be sure! Well, let{LF}me know when you've gathered the{LF}materials to build it, ＠カイル＠＠!
I will!
Oh! You have the materials and{LF}money required to build a school,{LF}I see! Well done, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Well done!
Thank you!
I'll call in some favors and get{LF}the best men I know on this{LF}project! The school should be{LF}finished in ten days!
T-Ten days! You can build the whole{LF}thing in ten days?!
It'll be no problem! These men{LF}are the best, after all!
I'm looking forward to the completion{LF}of the school, too!
You don't have enough wood to build the{LF}school. You need 1000 pieces of wood.
You don't have enough gold to build the{LF}school. You need 100,000G.
Barrett is a real thorn in my side.{LF}I guess complaining to you won't do any {LF}good, though, will it.
Barrett is a real thorn in my side. {LF}I wish he'd stop causing trouble.
Barrett is a real thorn in my side.{LF}Just what is that man thinking...?
Barrett is a real thorn in my side.{LF}I think you and I are getting along just {LF}fine, though, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm here to see Herman about something.{LF}Is that why you're here, too, perhaps?
The stairs in Herman's house are{LF}something else, aren't they! I wonder {LF}who he got to build them for him?
Herman is such an easy going, open{LF}hearted guy. The drinks we share are {LF}always such fun! Hah hah hah!
Herman does a lot for this town.{LF}I'm very grateful to him for everything.
Looking at the fountain always{LF}makes me feel peaceful.
The fountain really gives this place a{LF}cool, refreshing air, don't you think?
Have you been checking {LF}the bulletin board?{LF}I'm hoping you'll help out {LF}the people of our fair town.
Even this square looks different when{LF}it's covered in snow, doesn't it?
Looking at the sea always calms me down.
The wind here is always so cool.
Watching the sea always helps me{LF}relax.
The seas can be rough in winter.{LF}It can't be helped, but its still a {LF}problem.
Ah, here for the baths? A nice soak is{LF}the best thing to just wash away the {LF}aches and pains of hard work.
A bath in summer is great, isn't it!
Here to wash away another day's hard{LF}work, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Keep it up out there.
Get home before you cool off, that's the{LF}best thing after taking a bath. You {LF}don't want to catch cold, do you!
Ah, you must be the new fellow staying{LF}on Douglas' farm. Welcome to our{LF}humble town!
Thank you for having me.{LF}My name's ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm Byron, the mayor of this{LF}town. I hope you will enjoy{LF}living with us.
Thank you. I hope I can come{LF}to be friends with everyone{LF}living here.
This town may be small, but it's{LF}a peaceful, vibrant place. I hope{LF}you'll grow to like living here!
I'm sure I will!
Actually, I have a son around{LF}the same age as you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I hope the two of you can become{LF}friends.
That would be nice.
Things haven't been going so well{LF}between me and him recently, to be{LF}honest. We just seem to end up arguing{LF}about everything.
...
Anyway, I'm expecting big things{LF}from you, ＠カイル＠＠! Try to bring{LF}that farm back to life!
Yes, sir!
Ah, one other thing! There's a Lost{LF}and Found on the first floor {LF}of my house here.
If you lose anything important, you{LF}should take a look there. You might{LF}get it back!
Sounds good! Thank you!

With a strong and brave monster tamer{LF}like you here in town, there's nothing{LF}for us to fear!
Well done, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Good show.
Don't go walking around all hunched{LF}over, shoulders slumped, just because {LF}you lost. I'll be supporting you again {LF}next time!

Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's the Fishing Contest today.
This one requires some patience. I hope{LF}all the participants do their very best!
That was impressive! You hooked a real{LF}big one. Well done.
That's a shame. I guess hooking a big{LF}one isn't so easy after all.
It's the Big Cook-Off today.
How are your skills in the kitchen?{LF}If you're competent then{LF}why not take part?
Some impressive cookery there,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
You've got an instinct for it.{LF}Keep up the good work.
Well, you lost, but still. You made a{LF}good effort, and that's what counts.
Sometimes the judges just simply may not{LF}like the dish you choose to prepare. {LF}Don't let this get you too depressed.
Today is the day of the Adventure{LF}Contest. If you are going to take {LF}part, make sure you don't do anything{LF}too dangerous, okay?
Well done, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'm sure you can do better than that.
Just try harder next time. Good effort {LF}today.

Just try harder next time.{LF}Good effort, though.

Ah, the Shooting Star Festival!{LF}Such a beautiful occasion.
It's said that a wish made upon a{LF}shooting star will come true. How about {LF}giving it a try?

Phew, that Barrett can be tough to{LF}handle!
The town seems peaceful again today.
Phew, you're a lifesaver!{LF}Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠. I hate to do this,{LF}but can I ask a favor of you?
I want you to take this to Dorothy{LF}for me.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
It seems she's running low on medical{LF}supplies. So, if you could deliver{LF}this to her, that would be a big{LF}help.
Oh! Your backpack is full...{LF}Can you make some room in it?
Please give this ＠アイテム９＠ to{LF}Dorothy. Thanks for your help!
Ah, you made the delivery, did you?{LF}Thanks, you've been a big help.
I have to thank you somehow.{LF}Here, please take this.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}How's school going?
There's something I'd like to ask you,{LF}actually. Could you take this to Tanya{LF}for me?
She asked for it a while back, and I got {LF}it in from a neighboring town.
Seems they have better quality product{LF}over there. That's Tanya for you, strict {LF}on detail.
I can't tell the difference myself!{LF}Hah hah hah!
Here you go, anyway.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
I'm counting on you, ＠アルス＠＠.
You're carrying a lot already! How about{LF}making some room in that backpack of {LF}yours?
Will you take ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Tanya for me?
I'm counting on you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, you made the delivery?{LF}Thanks, you've been a big help.
No problem. Tanya has happy to receive{LF}it, too. She also told me to thank you, {LF}Mr. Mayor.

Good, good. Thanks again.
Now, I need to thank you for your{LF}trouble, don't I? Please, accept this.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I saw the bulletin board.{LF}Is there something that{LF}you need help with?
I need to talk to Barrett, actually.
But for some reason, I can't find him {LF}anywhere...
Where's he wandered off to this{LF}time?
Sorry, but could you tell Barrett that{LF}I need to talk to him?
I'm sorry to do this to you, but you're{LF}the only one I can ask.
Please find him!
Please tell Barrett that I want to see{LF}him.
Just where has that loafer Barrett got{LF}to...?!
Did Barrett come to see you? I did tell{LF}him you wanted to see him.
Yes, you were a big help! He didn't look{LF}all that pleased about it, though!{LF}Hah hah hah!
I see. Well, I'm glad it worked out.
All thanks to you.{LF}Please, take this in payment.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You'll find that very useful for keeping{LF}things in. Use it well!
Let me know if you need anything else.
You're carrying a lot already! How about{LF}making some room in that backpack of {LF}yours?
Mayor Byron, I saw the bulletin board. {LF}You're looking {LF}for people to patrol the town, correct?
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Yes, that's right.
It's part of my job as Mayor to protect {LF}the peaceful daily lives of our {LF}citizens, but I can't do it alone!
So I've been looking for people to help{LF}me out. What do you say,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Will you give it a try?
I'd very much like your help in keeping {LF}our town safe!
Of course. I would love to be a part of{LF}this.
Oh, you would? Wonderful!
In that case, please go and talk to{LF}everyone in the town and make sure {LF}nothing is wrong.
Once you've talked to them all, come{LF}back and report to me. I'm counting on {LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠!
Okay!
I hope no one needs your help,{LF}of course.
Of course.
Please go and talk to everyone in the{LF}town and make sure nothing is wrong.
Come back and talk to me once you're{LF}done making the rounds.
I'm counting on you!
Ah, well done, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How are things out there?
Nothing to report.{LF}Everything seems fine.
Good, good, I'm glad to hear it!{LF}Another peaceful day in our town!{LF}Hah hah hah! All thanks to you!
I wouldn't go quite that far.
Anyway, here is your payment. Just a{LF}little show of gratitude! My thanks.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thank you very much.
I'll be looking to you if I need some{LF}help again, ＠カイル＠＠!
I saw the bulletin board.{LF}Is there something that {LF}you need help with?
Ah, well, I don't like to ask for help{LF}with important business, but could you {LF}take these documents to Natalie for me?
She placed a request for them a while {LF}ago and they arrived from the city {LF}yesterday.
She must be getting quite impatient {LF}waiting for them! I want to get them {LF}to her as quickly as possible.
But of course, we are both so busy!{LF}That's where you come in.
Sure. I'll get them to Natalie,{LF}no problem.
Great! Thank you. Here are the{LF}documents, then.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Make sure you don't lose them! Get them{LF}to Natalie safely. I'm counting on you, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I need you to take the data {LF}from the capital to Natalie. {LF}She must be dying to {LF}get her hands on it!
I'm counting on you.
Ah, you made the delivery? Good work.
I'm sure Natalie was pleased, too.
Yes, she was very pleased.{LF}She told me to thank you, too.
Good, good! You've helped me to get{LF}through a busy day!
Now, here's something for your trouble.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'm sure I'll need your help again in{LF}the future.
You can't carry anything else at the {LF}moment. Can you make{LF}some room and then come back?
Isn't that sunlight wonderful!{LF}Spring has really come to town!
Ah, it's the Flower Festival tomorrow!{LF}Everyone will be drinking from midday, {LF}so it's going to be quite a festival! {LF}Hah hah hah!
Hmmm... That was quite an earthquake.{LF}I hope the town can withstand these{LF}quakes!
It's the Eating Contest tomorrow.{LF}If you are going to take part, try{LF}and pace yourself!
We don't want anyone choking in their{LF}race to win!
Swimming season starts tomorrow,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. I hope everyone has{LF}fun, but they also need to make{LF}sure that they're swimming safely.
It's the Monster Taming Contest{LF}tomorrow. I can't say that I care for{LF}monsters much, myself.
Hmmmm...another earthquake.{LF}I'm glad the town is okay...
But a priceless vase fell and shattered{LF}in my house. That's damage enough, I {LF}assure you.
It's hot every day now.{LF}Make sure you drink plenty of fluids!
Don't worry, I am.
Good, good. You can collapse from{LF}exhaustion before you even realize {LF}what's happening in this heat!
Ah, it's the Dance Festival tomorrow.{LF}I hope you can enjoy it along with all{LF}the other young people.
It's the Fishing Contest tomorrow.{LF}I'm sure you'll catch a fine fish!
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, are you{LF}planning on taking part in the Adventure {LF}Contest? I think we can expect good {LF}things from you, then!
Hmmm...yet another earthquake. There{LF}have been a few too many for my liking {LF}recently...
It's the Harvest Festival tomorrow.{LF}We have to thank the earth for its{LF}blessings, but we also have to thank you{LF}for growing them, ＠カイル＠＠!
Fall means different things for {LF}different people. Sports, study or good {LF}food. Personally, I enjoy it as the {LF}season of harvest.
It's the Monster Contest tomorrow,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. Enjoy yourself.
It's the Shooting Star Festival{LF}tomorrow. I hope the skies stay clear!
It's so cold in the morning now, isn't{LF}it! Winter is truly upon us. Looks like {LF}your energy isn't losing out to the {LF}cold, though! Good!
Ah, it's the Mining Contest tomorrow.{LF}To be honest, manual labor and shows of {LF}strength aren't as easy as they once {LF}where, at my age.
I guess you'll only understand in a good {LF}few more years, eh? Hah hah hah!
Hmmm...more earthquakes. I'm glad{LF}everyone is okay, but there have been so {LF}many of them recently, I'm quite {LF}worried.
And so, another year comes to a close. {LF}What kind of year was it for you?
Isn't that sunlight wonderful!{LF}Spring has really come to town!
It's hot every day now.{LF}Make sure you drink plenty of fluids!

Hello, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}Do you like Alvarna so far?
Alvarna welcomes you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
So, how do you like the town?{LF}I hope you grow to love it here.
Looks like you're a morning person!{LF}Do you eat breakfast every day?
You look in good health again today,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'm hoping you'll{LF}grow to love living here in town.
The town is quiet at night, isn't it.{LF}That's the time to just take it easy at {LF}home.

How are you getting along with the{LF}people of the town? I can't see you {LF}having any problem, anyway!
You seem to be getting along well with{LF}everyone in town, too. I think my son {LF}Barrett could learn a thing or two from {LF}you!
How are you getting along with the{LF}people of the town? I'm sure only good {LF}things will come from making friends {LF}here!
Our town is pretty far from the capital,{LF}Norad.
But that just means there is plenty of {LF}nature all around us! That's one of the {LF}best things about our town, I think. Hah {LF}hah hah!
Our town is pretty far from the capital, {LF}Norad.
That's why there is still so much nature {LF}all around us out here. People from the {LF}city often visit to take a break and {LF}relax.
Our town is pretty far from the capital, {LF}Norad. It's a relaxed, lovely place, {LF}don't you think?
How do you managed to have some much{LF}energy in the mornings, ＠カイル＠＠?
I wish you could share a little of that{LF}energy with me!
I'm glad to see you looking lively,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I wish Barrett would follow after your{LF}excellent example, I really do! Hah hah {LF}hah!
You're energy just runs on into the{LF}night, doesn't it ＠カイル＠＠!
I like to decorate my home with a{LF}＠アイテム８＠. They are lovely to{LF}look at, don't you think?
Flowers really do soothe the heart and{LF}mind!

That's all well and good, but be sure to{LF}take a break every once in a while too, {LF}okay?
The fish from these parts are really{LF}tasty. Head to the port and you'll see {LF}what I mean. Are you good at catching {LF}fish?

Good to see you working so hard right{LF}out of the gate, ＠カイル＠＠!
Are you enjoying life in town,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Dungeons are dangerous at night.{LF}Take care if you go out there!
Everyone tells me how great your crops {LF}and produce are. A sure sign that you {LF}are working hard, ＠カイル＠＠.
Has working the land helped you to{LF}remember anything from your past?
It looks like you've really taken well{LF}to the farming life. Keep it up,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.

Remember to take care, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}if you decide to farm inside a dungeon.
How is your farming inside a dungeon{LF}going, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}It's very dangerous in those places, so {LF}I'm sure it's quite challenging.
It's young people like you who have{LF}helped to make this town come alive. I'm {LF}very grateful for all you have done.

How are you feeling? Don't push yourself{LF}too hard, that's all I ask.
How are you feeling? Without a healthy{LF}body you won't be able to achieve {LF}anything else! Take care of yourself.
How are you feeling? Make a visit to the{LF}clinic in town, if you need to.
Let's hope that today is another{LF}peaceful one!
How is married life? I'm sure you're{LF}having a wonderful time!
Please let me know if you need help{LF}with anything.
How is married life, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I'm sure you're having a wonderful time!
I'm glad we've had another day without{LF}any incidents. Excellent work!
How are you finding newlywed life?{LF}Don't wear yourself out!
When I was young there was even more{LF}nature around these parts. Can you {LF}imagine it? Hah hah hah!
When I was young I had an athletic,{LF}healthy body, just like you. Can you {LF}imagine it? Hah hah hah!
I used to run around all over the place,{LF}just like you do now, when I was young. {LF}Looking at you now reminds me of good {LF}times.
Do you know of the Forest of{LF}Beginnings? It's a place full of{LF}monsters in a parallel world. I{LF}certainly don't want to visit it!

You are always working alongside nature.{LF}Have you ever felt the raw power of the {LF}earth, then? Respecting the earth is {LF}very important!
You are always working alongside nature. {LF}Respecting the earth is very important!
You work alongside the earth, so you{LF}must never forget to give thanks its {LF}blessings. We live thanks to the {LF}strength it lends us.
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, have{LF}you ever heard of the Elder Dragons?
It's a legendary dragon said to live in{LF}this country. They say it has the{LF}power to destroy all life on the{LF}planet.

When I told Barrett about this when he{LF}was small, well...
He was so scared that he wouldn't go to {LF}sleep without a night light! Hah hah hah!

It's a legendary dragon said to live in{LF}this country, with the power to destroy {LF}everything.

This town has really come to life since{LF}you arrived here, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm very grateful to you. My thanks.{LF}Keep up the good work!
This town has really become vibrant{LF}since you arrived here, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm very grateful to you. My thanks.{LF}Keep up the good work!
This town has really developed since you{LF}arrived here, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm very grateful to you. My thanks.{LF}Keep up the good work!
The school is yours.{LF}Please use it as you see fit.
Places with monsters are dangerous!{LF}Stay away from them!
If there is anything in town that you{LF}don't like, please don't hesitate to{LF}let me know.
How is school? I hope you're learning lots{LF}of useful things!
With young people like you, the future{LF}of our town is in good hands, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Hah hah hah!
I want to talk to you.
I want to make the barn larger.
I want to make the school larger.
I don't need anything right now.
Really? Well, come and see me any time.
The town has become vibrant and full of{LF}life. This is good!
It's summer, so it's awfully hot!{LF}Complaining about it won't do any good, {LF}though, will it? Hah hah hah!
Ah, my favorite season. I'm looking {LF}forward to the produce from your fields, {LF}too!
The fields look bare and lonely in{LF}winter, don't they.
An expansion to the barn. I see.{LF}Do you have 50 pieces of wood and{LF}5,000G ?
Ah, it looks like you have the required {LF}materials and money. Very well, I will {LF}make the arrangements.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I'll hire the best. It will be finished{LF}by tomorrow morning.
The barn will be finished tomorrow.{LF}Four levels will be added.
You can't make your barn any larger.
Mayor Byron, I'd like to make a{LF}further addition to the barn.{LF}Would that be okay?
Mayor Byron, I'd like to make a{LF}further addition to the barn.{LF}Would that be okay?
I don't know if there's any point in{LF}adding any more floors.
Just one more floor, please!
Just one more floor, please!
Well, if that's all you want, then okay.{LF}One more floor it is!
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
I'll foot the bill for the final floor{LF}myself. Work will start right away, so {LF}go take a look!
Thanks again, Mayor Byron!
Thanks again, Mayor Byron!
Hmmmm, you don't have enough wood.
Hmmm, you don't have enough gold.
You want to expand the school, eh?{LF}Well, what would you like to build?
A Library.
A Workshop.
A Dojo.
Nothing at the moment, actually
Really? Well, come and see me any time.
Ah, yes! A library filled with books {LF}and knowledge! An excellent idea.
You can also use it to play a board{LF}game called "Sugoroku"!
100 pieces of lumber and 10,000G will be{LF}needed to make the library. Are you sure{LF}you want to go ahead?
Yes, please.
I'll hold off for now.
Very well then, we'll expand the{LF}school with a library.{LF}It will be ready tomorrow morning.
I see. Come back if you change your{LF}mind, then.
A Workshop will let you{LF}combine weapons and items.
It will be an important facility for{LF}putting into practice everything you {LF}learn in school.
There are also numerous items you can{LF}only make here.
100 pieces of lumber and 10,000G will be{LF}needed to make the Workshop. {LF}Are you sure you want to go {LF}ahead?
Yes please.
I'll hold off for now.
Very well then, we'll expand the{LF}Workshop. It will be{LF}ready tomorrow morning.
I see. Come back if you change your{LF}mind, then.
A Dojo is a place of training, in both{LF}the martial arts and the body and mind. 
Train hard, and you'll surely learn new{LF}skills!
100 pieces of lumber and 10,000G will be{LF}needed to make the Dojo. Are you sure{LF}you want to go ahead?
Yes please.
I'll hold off for now.
Very well then, we'll expand the Dojo.{LF}It will be ready tomorrow morning.
I see. Come back if you change your{LF}mind, then.
It will be finished for tomorrow{LF}morning. Look forward to it!
You've already had that built.
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You may use the school as you see fit.

I'm here to see Herman on personal{LF}business. You want to see him too?
The stairs in Herman's house are{LF}something else, aren't they! I wonder {LF}who he got to build them for him?
Herman is such an easy going, open{LF}hearted guy. The drinks we share are {LF}always such fun! Hah hah hah!
Herman does a lot for this town.{LF}I'm very grateful to him for everything.
Looking at the fountain always{LF}makes me feel peaceful.
The fountain really gives this place a{LF}cool, refreshing air, don't you think?
Lots of people always gather here in{LF}the square.
I want this place to be somewhere that{LF}helps people to come together. That is {LF}my wish.
Even this square looks different when {LF}it's covered in snow, doesn't it?
Looking at the sea always calms me down.
The wind here is always so cool.
Looking at the sea is wonderful, don't{LF}you think ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I love the view from here.
The sea is cold enough to freeze you{LF}solid in winter. Make sure you don't {LF}fall in!
Ah, here for the baths? A nice soak is{LF}the best thing to just wash away the {LF}aches and pains of hard work.
A bath in summer is great, isn't it!
Do you like to take a bath,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? I certainly do.
Even the warmth of a long bath doesn't {LF}last long in winter, does it.
Dungeons are dangerous places.{LF}Stay away from them!
You're not going into any dungeons, are{LF}you? They're dangerous, so stay away {LF}from them!
That's why it is my job to make the town {LF}safe for everyone to live in.
Any problems or issues you want to{LF}discuss? Don't hesitate to let me know {LF}if there is.
You're growing up fast, I must say!{LF}And really starting to look like{LF}＠カイル＠＠, too.
So ＠カイル＠＠ came back, did he?{LF}That's excellent news, ＠アルス＠＠!
How are you, ＠カイル＠＠?
How are you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Bah... I can't find it...{LF}this is bad...!
Barrett, is this the book you are{LF}looking for?
!!
Yeah, that's the one! You found it!{LF}Well done.
I'm glad I was able to help.{LF}But just what kind of book is it...?
That's none of your business.{LF}No need to worry about it, okay?
O-Okay...
Anyway, thanks for finding it.{LF}Here's something to make us even.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks. See ya.
You're carrying too much stuff.{LF}Get rid of some of it, will you?
Is that for me? Thanks...
Barrett, I've got the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}that you asked for.
Ah, you got it! Thanks!
Now my work can continue...
?
Just what are you using that{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for, Barrett?
Ah...nothing that would interest you.{LF}It's not important. Really.
You're not very convincing.{LF}Come on! What's the big secret?
You're getting on my nerves! We're{LF}finished here, okay?
Here's your reward. Take it and go,{LF}please. And...thanks.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Is that for me? Thanks...
Is that for me? Thanks...
I've got ＠アイテム９＠ for you.
Ah, you got it! That's a big help!
Just what are you using{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for, Barrett?
Don't you worry about that.{LF}It's nothing to do with you.
I see. It sounds a bit dangerous,{LF}though...
Enough! Go away!
Oh, but take this first. Some cash to{LF}keep you quiet! Now don't go poking into {LF}my stuff!
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Is that for me? Thanks...
Is that for me? Thanks...
You got it? Great, thanks.
Now I can further improve your lessons.
Here's something for your help,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. Thanks.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I'll let you know if{LF}I need any more help.
I can have this?{LF}Thank you.
You're carrying too much.{LF}Clear out some room in your{LF}backpack.{LF}
I can have this?{LF}Thank you.
You finished making it?
Good job. You pass.
You did well. Take this as a{LF}reward.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I know that you've been searching{LF}for your father. This should come{LF}in handy for you.
I'm going to give this quiz to the{LF}other students later.
Don't tell anyone about it. I want to{LF}keep it a surprise.
I understand. I'll keep it a secret.
I understand. I'll keep it a secret.
Thanks.
I can have this?{LF}Thank you.
You seem to be carrying too much.{LF}Please clear out some room in your{LF}backpack.{LF}
Barrett, Orland wanted me to give{LF}this to you.
Barrett, Orland wanted me to give{LF}this to you.
*sigh*... What, did Orland not feel{LF}like doing it himself?
Anyway, thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}And tell Orland to do it{LF}himself next time, will you?
I can have this?{LF}Thank you.
Hey, I asked Ray for this...{LF}Why do you have it?
Ray asked me to bring it to you.
Hmph, that Ray...
Barrett,{LF}you think about your father{LF}a lot, don't you?
Of course I do.{LF}It's not like I hate him.{LF}I mean, sure, we fight sometimes,{LF}but that doesn't mean anything.{LF}
Wouldn't it be better if{LF}you told him how you felt?
I don't think it's any of your business.
Sorry.
We're two guys, okay?{LF}We don't need to be all huggy{LF}and emotional.
Hm, if that's how you feel{LF}about it...
Anyway, you've made your delivery.{LF}Tell Ray thanks for me.
I will.
I can have this?{LF}I don't really need it.
What am I supposed to do with this?{LF}You can keep it.
What, you're giving this to me?{LF}Well, I don't mind or anything.
Thanks.
This is a nice gift.{LF}Thanks.
Don't ask about what{LF}I intend to use it for though.
Hmph! Why did you bring me something {LF}like that? I don't want a {LF}＠アイテム７＠ at all.
I don't need that.
What, you're giving this to me?{LF}Well, I don't mind or anything.
Thanks.
This is a nice gift.{LF}Thanks.
I might be able to use this{LF}for my next lesson.
Hmph! Why did you bring me something {LF}like that? I don't want a {LF}＠アイテム７＠ at all.
I don't need that!
Drink this.
What is that?
Thanks, I owe you one.
Here, take this.
Here, take this.
What is it?
You're in a good mood.{LF}I think it's contagious.
What's this, all of a sudden?{LF}Is that a present for me?{LF}That would be a perfect gift {LF}if you gave it to me on my birthday.
What's this, all of a sudden?{LF}Is that a present for me?{LF}That would be a perfect gift {LF}if you gave it to me on my birthday.
You knew it was my birthday today?{LF}Thanks for the present.
You knew it was my birthday today?{LF}Thanks for the present.
I only need one present.

I can't give this.

I can have this?{LF}I don't really need it.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can have this?{LF}I don't really need it.
Why are you in my home?
There's nothing for you to do in here.
Did you need something?
Don't just barge in here without asking.
If you don't need anything,{LF}would you please leave?
I don't have anything for you here.
Why'd you bother coming out here?
What are you doing here?
It's too noisy here...
I know this place is big,{LF}but try to keep the noise down.
I'm not comfortable in noisy places.{LF}It's too loud here.
I prefer the quiet.{LF}There are too many people here.
What do you want?
It's hot out.
Don't you have anything to do?
What?
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}It doesn't concern you.
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}Don't bother me.
What a nice breeze...{LF}It's easy to lose track{LF}of the time like this.
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}Am I bothering you?
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
What are you doing here?
It's nice and quiet here.
It's nice and quiet here.
It's cold out.
If you're going in there,{LF}try not to make too much noise.
What?
If you're going in there,{LF}wash yourself off first.
I'm cold.{LF}I think I'll go in...
What is it?
What do you want?
You need something?
What?
Who are you...?
Hi, my name's ＠カイル＠＠!
Oh.
Umm... What's your name?
Barrett.
...
......
.........
Anything else you need?
N-No. Nothing at all...
Good morning.
...
Hello.
...
Hello.
...
Morning.
Hi.
Hi.
Morning.{LF}Don't you ever have anything to do?
Hi.{LF}Don't you ever have anything to do?
Hi.{LF}Don't you ever have anything to do?
Morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How are you?
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How are you?
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How are you?
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.
Evening, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You shouldn't be out this late.
It's another year.
You don't have to make{LF}such a fuss about it.
It's another year.
Well, Happy New Year.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}I guess looking at flowers{LF}isn't that terrible.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}I guess looking at flowers{LF}isn't that terrible.
There's a festival today.{LF}I don't like everyone getting{LF}all worked up about it.
Nice job.
That's too bad.
There's a festival today.{LF}I don't like everyone getting{LF}all worked up about it.
Nice job.
That's too bad.
Summer starts today...
But why should I care?{LF}I'm not a little kid anymore.
Swimming season starts today...
You can go swimming if you want,{LF}but don't drown yourself or anything.
Today's the Monster{LF}Taming Contest. Does that sound {LF}like any fun to you?
You did well.
What were you thinking?{LF}You can do better than that!
Today's the Monster{LF}Taming Contest. That's a {LF}strange idea for a contest.
It looks like you did well...
That's too bad.
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}I don't want any part of it...{LF}Why don't you go enjoy yourself?
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}I don't want any part of it...{LF}Why don't you go dance the Hokey{LF}Pokey or whatever?
Today's the Fishing Contest.{LF}I don't mind fishing...
That was quite a catch.{LF}Nice work.
You're not very good, are you?{LF}That was a pretty sad catch.
Fishing isn't bad every once in a while.
Today's the Big Cook-Off.{LF}Are you going to enter,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
You look like you'd be good at cooking.
Don't push yourself too hard.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}It sounds childish to me...
You won. Just don't let it go to{LF}your head.
You could have done better than that.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}You're still a kid, so I bet{LF}it must sound like fun to you.
You must be proud of yourself.{LF}You did well.
Didn't it go well?
We're supposed to give thanks for our{LF}food today. It's important not to{LF}take these things for granted.
Today's the Harvest Festival.{LF}I guess giving thanks can't be{LF}a bad thing.
Today's the Monster Contest.{LF}It's stupid for all of you to get{LF}so worked up over nothing important.
That was pointless.{LF}What good did that do anyone?
Fishing isn't bad every once in a while.
Today's the Monster Contest.{LF}Do you really think it's good to{LF}make a contest out of monsters?
I think I just saw another side of you.
That was too bad.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I've gotten too old to make wishes {LF}on stars.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I hope I get to see some shooting{LF}stars tonight.
Are you crazy? I'm not going to{LF}have anything to do with some{LF}stupid Mining Contest.
Not bad.
Hmph.
There's a Mining Contest today.{LF}You're probably still too young for{LF}that, ＠アルス＠＠.
Not bad.
That was too bad.{LF}Maybe when you're a little older.
It's the end of another year.{LF}What an unremarkable year this was.
It's the end of another year.{LF}Time can pass by so quickly.
Good job.
Good job.
Good job.
This book? Oh, it's, um, nothing.{LF}Don't worry about it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
You've saved me a lot of work.
Do you need something?
Yeah, actually. Orland told me that{LF}he wishes your classes were more{LF}difficult.
He did? I guess my lessons have been{LF}a little lacking.
I didn't know he felt that way,{LF}though. But he does seem to enjoy{LF}learning at a faster pace than the{LF}rest of you guys.
All right, I'll make more challenging{LF}lessons just for Orland. The regular{LF}lessons should be enough for the rest{LF}of you.
But Orland should've come talk to{LF}me directly about this, instead{LF}of dragging you into it. I don't{LF}know what to do with him sometimes.
Well, I was impressed, because I had{LF}never even really thought about it{LF}myself.
I suppose. He's hard to understand{LF}sometimes, but I guess he has his{LF}own way of thinking about things.
Make no mistake, though. He has{LF}his good qualities, too. I hope{LF}you continue to get along with{LF}him.
Thanks! I'll try!
That's all you needed, right?{LF}Tell Orland that I'll prepare{LF}special lessons just for him.{LF}Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
I wish Orland would think of{LF}others sometimes.
What is it?{LF}Do you need something?
Byron has to talk {LF}to you about something.{LF}Could you go see him?
What, couldn't he come{LF}tell me that himself?
I can't stand him...
I'm sure he was just busy{LF}and couldn't help it, that's all.
And what do you think you're doing{LF}by taking on such a pointless job?
Well...
All right, you just need me to{LF}go see my dad, right?
This has to be a joke.
Well, thanks for telling me.
Bye.
Uh, all right. Bye.
(Is he going to go talk to Byron?)
(Well, I'd better report {LF}back, at least.)
Is anything wrong?
No, not really.
That's good.
What is it?
What?{LF}If you don't need anything,{LF}go away.
Wait! Um...{LF}I'm here about your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
Oh, is that it?
Yes.{LF}What are you looking for?
A book.{LF}I must have dropped it somewhere.
I need that book.{LF}I'd be grateful if {LF}you could help me find it.
I didn't know that you liked to read,{LF}Barrett.
Whatever.{LF}It's not like it's unusual to{LF}like to read.
Oh, no, of course it's not. Sorry.
Um, so, what does your book look like?{LF}Do you remember where you had it last?
What does it look like?{LF}It's very thick and heavy.{LF}It's a fairly large book.
I'm not sure where I had it last,{LF}but...
Today, I was in the general store,{LF}the church... I've been around here, {LF}too. Try looking around those places.
The general store and the church?{LF}I'll take a look.
Yeah, thanks.
Would you search the general{LF}store and the church for me?{LF}I can't believe I managed{LF}to lose that book.
Thanks for finding it for me.{LF}Here, take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks again.{LF}Bye.
You're carrying too much right now.{LF}Get rid of some of that.
What? If you don't need anything,{LF}just leave me alone.
Um, I'm here about your {LF}request on the bulletin board.
Oh, you're here for that?{LF}I'm looking for someone to help{LF}me get my hands on something.
I want you to bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
It's not that difficult of a job.{LF}Even you shouldn't have too much{LF}trouble with it.
I'd do it myself, but I'm busy.
Well, how about it? Will you do it?
Um, yes.{LF}Leave it to me.
Good. Thank you.
You should be able to get a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ from a{LF}＠モンスター９＠ in{LF}Trieste Forest.
You shouldn't have any trouble{LF}fighting those monsters.{LF}Good luck.
Oh, I almost forgot.{LF}I've got one more thing to tell you.{LF}I need you to find it quickly. {LF}I'm in a hurry.
You should be able to get a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ from a{LF}＠モンスター９＠ in{LF}Trieste Forest.
You shouldn't have any trouble{LF}fighting those monsters.{LF}Good luck.
What? Do you need something?
Yes, I'm here about your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
Oh, that's why you're here?
I want you to bring me another item.{LF}This time, I need a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
This won't be difficult for you.{LF}You should be used to dealing with{LF}monsters by now, right?
You can sometimes find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ when you defeat a{LF}＠モンスター９＠.
They should be somewhere on{LF}Blessia Island.
When you find one, bring it back to me.
Don't take too long.{LF}Good luck.
You can sometimes find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ when you defeat a{LF}＠モンスター９＠.
They should be somewhere on{LF}Blessia Island.
When you find one, bring it back to me.
What do you want?
I'm here about your request on{LF}the bulletin board.
Oh, that?{LF}I want you to deliver this to Dorothy.
She dropped it, but I don't want to{LF}bother with returning it myself.
I thought it would be better{LF}to ask you, since you're not{LF}doing much else anyway.
Here, take it.{LF}Thanks...
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Hey, you're carrying too much.{LF}Get rid of some stuff.
Deliver that{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Dorothy for me.
Don't mess up.
Did you give it to Dorothy?{LF}Thanks.
Dorothy told me to thank you, too.
Really? She did?
Well, here's your reward.{LF}Take it.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Bye.
What do you want?
I saw your request on the bulletin board.
I saw your request on the bulletin board.
Oh, you did? Thanks for coming.{LF}Let me explain.
I thought I would use ＠アイテム９＠{LF}in my next class, but I'm completely{LF}out.
Could you bring me another piece{LF}of ＠アイテム９＠?
Since it's for your own class anyway,{LF}I thought that you'd want to help out.
Of course!
Of course!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Bring me a piece of ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}It's for your own class, so if{LF}you help out, you'll be doing{LF}yourself a favor, too.
I thought I would use a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ in my next class,{LF}but I'm completely out of them.{LF}I want you to bring me ＠数字８＠ more.
Here's your reward.{LF}Take it.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I'll let you know if{LF}I need any more help.
Clear out some room in your backpack.{LF}I can't fit anything else in there{LF}right now.
What is it, ＠アルス＠＠?
I saw your request on the bulletin board.
I saw your request on the bulletin board.
Ah, right.
Give this ＠アイテム９＠ to Jake for me.
It's unusual for him to want anything{LF}something like a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I wonder what's up?
I don't understand that guy{LF}sometimes...
Anyway, thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Your backpack is full. Make some{LF}room for it.
Give that ＠アイテム９＠ to Jake for me.
It's unusual for him to want anything{LF}something like a ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I wonder what's up?
I don't understand that guy{LF}sometimes...
Anyway, thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Did you give it to him?
Yes! He said he was going to cut{LF}right through it with one of his{LF}swords! Isn't that amazing?
Yes! He said he was going to cut{LF}right through it with one of his{LF}swords! Isn't that amazing?
Hmph. Well, that does sound like{LF}something Jake would do.{LF}Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Here's your reward.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks again.
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠. Are you having{LF}fun in school?
I get the feeling that you kids{LF}are a bit bored during class.
You're still doing all right,{LF}but Roy, for example, keeps{LF}falling asleep in class.
As a teacher, I can't accept that.{LF}That's why I'm going to have a{LF}pop quiz to see how well you're{LF}learning to make items.
I want you to create something{LF}for me right now.
What? Right now?
What? Right now?
Yes, right now! That's the point of{LF}a pop quiz! Now listen, because I'm{LF}going to explain what I want you to do.
I want you to make me some{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
That should be easy enough.
Do you know what materials you need?{LF}If you've been paying attention to my {LF}lessons and not been neglecting{LF}your studies, you should know by now.
Prepare your materials.{LF}As soon as you have them ready,{LF}consider the quiz underway.
Good luck.
This is mean, Barrett!
This is mean, Barrett!
It's for your own good.{LF}Stop whining.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...
Use the forge to make ＠アイテム９＠.
Do you know what materials you need?{LF}If you've been paying attention to my {LF}lessons and not neglecting{LF}your studies, you should know by now.
Prepare your materials.{LF}As soon as you have them ready,{LF}consider the quiz underway.
Good luck.
You did well.{LF}Take this as a reward.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I know that you've been searching{LF}for your father inside the dungeons.{LF}This should come in handy.
Now, I have to give this quiz to{LF}the other students as well.
Keep it a secret for me, all{LF}right? I want it to be a{LF}surprise.
I understand.{LF}I'll keep it a secret.
I understand.{LF}I'll keep it a secret.
Thanks.
You seem to be carrying too much.{LF}Please make some room in your backpack.{LF}
What do you want?
Oh, it's nothing, really, just...
If it's nothing, then why are you{LF}bothering me?
No, I, um...{LF}Don't you think we could have{LF}an honest conversation, you know,{LF}man-to-man?
Is there something you need{LF}to say?
Um, well, I was just wondering{LF}if there was, uh, anyone that you liked.
What?{LF}What do you care who I like?
Ah, ha ha ha.{LF}Why? Um, no reason.{LF}I guess I don't care, really.
You're weird.
Ha ha ha...
I don't feel like talking about that{LF}with you. Not right now, at least.
R-Right.
If you don't need anything else,{LF}you can go now.
What do you want?
Be good to Ray.{LF}He's a good guy.{LF}Listen to him if he asks for your help.
......
Ah-choo!
What do you want?
I'm sure there's going to be a big{LF}fuss tomorrow. Adults will take any{LF}excuse to act like fools.
Was that an earthquake?{LF}I wasn't hurt, but... 
Tomorrow is the Eating Contest.{LF}What kind of stupid contest is that?
We can go swimming in the sea{LF}starting tomorrow, but I'd {LF}rather just watch the waves.
Tomorrow is the Monster{LF}Taming Contest.{LF}Is it really that exciting to{LF}watch a bunch of monsters?
Another earthquake...
Aren't you getting hot standing there?
There's a dance tomorrow.{LF}It sounds boring.
I heard that there's going to be a {LF}Fishing Contest tomorrow.{LF}I guess fishing isn't that bad.
There's going to be an{LF}Adventure Contest, but I'm{LF}not interested at all.
There was another earthquake.{LF}This is starting to get dangerous.
The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.{LF}It doesn't really feel like much of{LF}a festival to me.
It's starting to get colder out.
Ridiculous.{LF}What's so fun about {LF}a Monster Contest?
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I guess everyone has their own wish.
The wind feels cold today.
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest.{LF}I don't have time for that.
We had another earthquake.{LF}This is starting to get annoying.
We're at the end of another year.{LF}What an unremarkable year this was.
It's gotten warmer out.
It's pretty hot out.{LF}Don't let that distract{LF}from your studies.
This town is covered with autumn leaves.
Yet another cold day.{LF}You're not catching a cold,{LF}are you, ＠アルス＠＠?
You're still here?
What?
You're in my way.
What do you need this early?
If you don't need anything, go away.
Do you need something?
What is it?
Oh, um,{LF}I was just wondering if{LF}you had a favorite food.
Why do you want to know?
I like fish...{LF}＠アイテム９＠, for example... 
That's all you need to know.
What is it?
Oh, um,{LF}I was just wondering if{LF}you had a favorite food.
Why do you want to know?
I like fish...{LF}＠アイテム９＠, for example...

Why do you want to know?
I like fish...{LF}＠アイテム９＠, for example...
That's all you need to know.
I don't have anything to say to you.
I don't have anything to say to you.{LF}Leave me alone.
I don't have anything to say to you.{LF}Quit bugging me.
What is it? You're bothering me.
Hmph.{LF}Don't talk to me if you{LF}don't have anything to say.
I'm trying to think here. Go away.
It's too early for this... 
What do you think you're doing?
It doesn't matter how much you{LF}follow me around. I still don't{LF}have anything to say to you.
Is there anything you'd like {LF}someone to give you?
Why do you ask all of a sudden?{LF}I could always use another{LF}＠アイテム８＠.{LF}They have so many uses... {LF}
Is there anything you'd like {LF}someone to give you?

Is there anything you'd like {LF}someone to give you?
Why do you ask all of a sudden?{LF}I could always use another{LF}＠アイテム８＠.{LF}They have so many uses... {LF}
I don't have time to{LF}look after you right now.
Get on out of here.{LF}I don't have time to{LF}look after you right now.
Get out of here.{LF}You're blocking my view.
Sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Sorry, could you go somewhere else?
You again?{LF}I don't have time to{LF}look after you right now.
Barrett, is there anything you dislike?
Hmmm...{LF}I wouldn't even want to look at an{LF}＠アイテム７＠.
Barrett, is there anything you dislike?
Hmmm...{LF}I wouldn't even want to look at an{LF}＠アイテム７＠.
Barrett, is there anything you dislike?
Hmmm...{LF}I wouldn't even want to look at an{LF}＠アイテム７＠.
Barrett, when is your birthday?
What's it to you?{LF}It's the 5th of Spring.{LF}Do you have a problem with that?
Barrett, when is your birthday?
What's it to you?{LF}It's the 5th of Spring.{LF}Do you have a problem with that?
Barrett, when is your birthday?
What's it to you?{LF}It's the 5th of Spring.{LF}Do you have a problem with that?
Don't you have something else you{LF}should be doing besides talking to me?
Oh, uh, I just thought I'd say hi.
Get back to your work then.
How about taking the time you're{LF}wasting by trying to yak at me{LF}and spending that time working on{LF}your farm, instead?
You should go home soon.{LF}Aren't you tired from working outside?
Everyone avoids me.
Don't listen to what my father says.
I've got another big day tomorrow{LF}and I'd like to get some sleep.
I don't care about you.
You shouldn't be talking{LF}to me right now.
You shouldn't be talking{LF}to me right now.
Don't you have anything else to do?{LF}I think you need to find a {LF}purpose in life.
Don't you have anything else to do?{LF}I can't think of any reason{LF}you'd want to talk to me.
Now that I think about it, your field{LF}used to be in pretty bad shape.
Go away.{LF}I don't have any use for you right now.
Go away.{LF}I don't have anything to say to you.
Go away.{LF}I don't need you for anything right now.
You're always in a good mood.
I don't want to hear{LF}about how good your life is.
You should take it easy at night.{LF}Don't you have a lot of farm work to{LF}do tomorrow?
You've got so much energy for{LF}this early in the morning.{LF}I'm exhausted just looking at you.
You look like you're having fun.
You shouldn't be staying out so late.
How's everything on the farm?
Good. I'm managing to get by all{LF}right.
That's good.
How's the farming going?
Good. I'm managing to get by all{LF}right.
That's good.
Is everything good on the farm?
Good. I'm managing to get by all{LF}right.
Hmph.
Do you need something?
Oh, no, I was just... 
Hmph. You're weird.
Do you need something?
Oh, no, I was just... 
Hmph. What are you after?
Do you need something?
Oh, no, I was just... 
Hmph. Don't talk to me if{LF}you don't have a good reason.
Why do you keep living {LF}the way you do?
I don't have a particular reason,{LF}I guess. If I didn't like it,{LF}I'd change it.
I see...
Why do you keep living {LF}the way you do?
I don't have a particular reason,{LF}I guess. If I didn't like it,{LF}I'd change it.
If you're having fun, then I guess{LF}there isn't anything wrong with that.
Why do you keep living {LF}the way you do?
I don't have a particular reason,{LF}I guess. If I didn't like it,{LF}I'd change it.
You don't have a reason?
You're always by yourself, Barrett.
Yeah, well, I like being alone.
I think it would be good if{LF}you spent some time with{LF}someone else once in a while.
I can do whatever I want.
You're always by yourself, Barrett.
Yeah, well, I like being alone.
I think it would be good if{LF}you talked with someone else{LF}once in a while.
If I ever feel like it, I will.
You're always by yourself, Barrett.
That's because I don't ever really{LF}feel like talking to anyone else.
I think it would be good if{LF}you spent some time with{LF}someone else once in a while.
Why do you waste time talking to me?
I don't think you're as bad as{LF}everyone thinks, Barrett.
Hmph. Well, whatever.
Why do you waste time talking to me?
I don't think you're as bad as{LF}everyone thinks, Barrett.
You can think whatever you want.
Don't waste your time worrying{LF}about me so much.
I don't think you're as bad as{LF}everyone thinks, Barrett.
You can think whatever you want.
Does anyone ever tell you{LF}that you're strange?
No. Why? Do you think I'm strange?
Well, everyone else is{LF}too afraid to come talk to me.
I'm sure people must tell you{LF}that you're strange.
What? What's strange about me?
Well, everyone else is{LF}too afraid to come talk to me.{LF}You're different.
I'm sure people must tell you{LF}that you're strange.
What? Why?{LF}I don't know why anyone would.
Well, everyone else is{LF}too afraid to come talk to me.
You're unusual, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I don't know why you'd try to be{LF}friends with someone like me.
I think you're really a good person,{LF}Barrett. In fact, I'd guarantee it.
Hmph. There you go saying strange{LF}things again.
You're unusual, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I don't know why you'd try to be{LF}friends with someone like me.
I think you're really a good person,{LF}Barrett. In fact, I'd guarantee it.
Hmph. See, that's exactly why I say{LF}you're weird.
You're unusual, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I don't know why you'd try to be{LF}friends with someone like me.
I think you're really a good person,{LF}Barrett. In fact, I'd guarantee it.
Hmph, you're definitely unusual.
You remind me of your father,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Have you made friends at school?{LF}I hope you can get along with everyone.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}your father used to work very hard{LF}on his farm.
I don't know what to do with Roy.{LF}He keeps falling asleep in class.
It looks like you're making lots of{LF}friends at school. I'm glad for you.
Did you need something?
There's nothing for you to do in here.
Did you need something?
Don't play around in here.
Are you here to see Leonel?
There's nothing fun for you to do here.
If you have a question about class,{LF}I could answer it for you.
Did you have a question about class?
You can play here if you'd like,{LF}but try not to make too much noise.
I know there's plenty of{LF}room for you to play around{LF}here, but keep it quiet.
If you get reckless, {LF}you're going to end up{LF}getting yourself hurt.
Don't run around here.{LF}You're going to slip {LF}and fall in the snow.
Did you need something?{LF}I know it's nice outside now,{LF}but try not to cause any trouble.
Don't get too close to me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. I'm hot.
Are you bored?{LF}You should try playing{LF}with some of the other kids.
What is it?{LF}Why are you running around so much?{LF}Aren't you cold?
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}It doesn't concern you.
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}Don't bother me.
What a nice breeze... {LF}It's easy to lose track{LF}of the time like this.
I'm just looking at the sea.{LF}Am I bothering you?
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Not very many people pass through here.{LF}It's nice and quiet.
Do you like school, ＠アルス＠＠?
I feel relaxed when I'm at school.
I never thought I'd become a teacher.
Aren't you cold, ＠アルス＠＠?
If you're going in,{LF}don't cause any trouble.{LF}I hate it when Roy starts{LF}swimming around in here.
Did you come to take a bath?
Be careful. You'll get dizzy if{LF}you stay in there too long.
It's so cold out, sometimes{LF}it's hard to get out of the bath.
You're in a good mood today.
Did you need something?
What is it?
Why did you come to church?{LF}Are you here to see Cammy?
I want to talk to you.
I want a lesson.
I read your note on the bulletin board.
Never mind.
I don't have anything to talk about.
Time to start class.
I teach forging classes.
I'm going to write instructions{LF}up on the board.{LF}You'll need to take notes.{LF}
In order to forge something, you'll need{LF}use of the Workshop. Without{LF}it, you won't be able to make anything,{LF}even if you've finished my lessons.
Really?
Until we have a Workshop,{LF}you'll just have to study in class.
Yes, sir.
There's nothing wrong{LF}with studying ahead.
It's good to study ahead, in fact.
It is?
Until we have a Workshop,{LF}you'll just have to study in class.
Yes, sir.
I hope someone will build that{LF}classroom soon!
I like Barrett's class because it's fun.
(I guess Dad didn't build{LF}that part of the school. I'll have{LF}to finish it myself!)
(I guess Dad didn't build{LF}that part of the school. I'll have{LF}to finish it myself!)
All right, class dismissed.{LF}See you all tomorrow.
All right, class dismissed.{LF}See you all tomorrow.
Don't forget to study.{LF}Studying hard prepares you for{LF}life as an adult.
Did you always do your studying{LF}when you were a kid, Barrett?
Did you always do your studying{LF}when you were a kid, Barrett?
Urk... {LF}We're not talking about me.{LF}Just do your homework.
Why are there monsters in{LF}the dungeons outside of town?
Why are there monsters in{LF}the dungeons outside of town?
The monsters come through{LF}the gates that connect the{LF}dungeons to the Forest of Beginnings.
Why are the gates there?
Why are the gates there?
I don't know that myself.{LF}Not much is known about{LF}the gates themselves.
The Sechs Empire uses machines{LF}called "Shifts" to summon monsters,{LF}but those only work because of the{LF}gates enclosed within them.
Not even the scholars of the{LF}Sechs Empire have the knowledge{LF}to create new gates on their own.
They can only enclose the gates {LF}and open and close them at will.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
By the way, why are you curious{LF}about the gates, anyway?{LF}You haven't been going outside{LF}of town, have you?
N-No, of course I haven't!
N-No, of course I haven't!
That's good.{LF}Stay away from the{LF}dungeons outside of town.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Barrett,{LF}I have something I want you to see.
Barrett,{LF}I have something I want you to see.
What is it?
Could you look at this tablet?{LF}I can't read some of the words.
Could you look at this tablet?{LF}I can't read some of the words.
The writing on this tablet... {LF}It's printed in Earthscript.
Earthscript?
Earthscript?
It's a script used by the ancient{LF}Earthmates. You... You can read{LF}this?
I know that there's no reason{LF}that I should be able to read it,{LF}but I understand what it says.
I know that there's no reason{LF}that I should be able to read it,{LF}but I understand what it says.
......
What does the rest say?
What does the rest say?
Very few people still understand the{LF}language of the Earthmates. I can't{LF}read much of it, either, but it{LF}would make for interesting research.
Legend says that Earthscript {LF}could call forth the most{LF}powerful of magics.
Really?
Really?
By the way, ＠アルス＠＠.
What?
What?
Where did you find this?
What?! Um, well, y-you see,{LF}I was... I was digging in{LF}my field, and I just, kind of,{LF}dug it up.
What?! Um, well, y-you see,{LF}I was... I was digging in{LF}my field, and I just, kind of,{LF}dug it up.
In your field, you say? Hmph.{LF}Your father was a terrible{LF}liar, too. You're just like{LF}him.
Well, children always want to do {LF}what they're told they can't do, and{LF}to go where they're told they can't.
......
......
My father was always strict, and was{LF}always telling me what I couldn't do.{LF}I guess that's why I never got along{LF}with him very well...
Oh... 
Oh... 
But why are you going into the dungeons?
......
......
What's wrong?
You won't tell anyone?
You won't tell anyone?
I promise.
I'm looking for clues about my{LF}father.
I'm looking for clues about my{LF}father.
Clues about your father?
Yes... I'm positive that he's{LF}still alive somewhere. My mom{LF}believes it, too.
Yes... I'm positive that he's{LF}still alive somewhere. My mom{LF}believes it, too.
I understand. I won't tell anyone{LF}that you're going into the{LF}dungeons, all right?
Really? You won't?
Really? You won't?
But you have to promise me one thing,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. Don't do anything too{LF}dangerous. Be careful out there.
Yes! Yes, sir!
Yes! Yes, sir!
I have a feeling that something{LF}very important is written on this{LF}tablet. I'm going to see if I can{LF}find anything out.
It looks like we have all of{LF}the pieces of the tablet now.
This tablet looks like it's only{LF}one part of the whole. I think there{LF}must be more pieces to find yet.
I found another piece of the tablet.
I found another piece of the tablet.
Let me see it.{LF}Yes... This is just like the{LF}first piece you brought me.
Were you able to figure out what{LF}the last one I brought said?
Were you able to figure out what{LF}the last one I brought said?
I don't know yet.{LF}But Mana is helping me decipher it.
What?!{LF}Mom is helping you?
What?!{LF}Mom is helping you?
What?!{LF}Mana is helping you?
What?!{LF}Mana is helping you?
Don't worry, I've kept your secret.{LF}I told her that I was the one who{LF}found it.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Be careful inside the dungeons.
Yes, I will!
Yes, I will!
It's proving difficult to decipher{LF}the writings on this tablet,{LF}but I like a good challenge.
It looks like we have all of{LF}the pieces of the tablet now.
If I'm correct, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}some very powerful magic is {LF}written upon this tablet.
You were able to read it?
You were able to read it?
Not all of it.{LF}Mana sent a letter to the Royal{LF}College in Palermo, the capital {LF}of Norad.
They allowed us the use of some of their{LF}texts, and we have finally been able{LF}to make progress on the tablet.
The only reason we were able{LF}to have any contacts in the Royal{LF}College at all is because{LF}＠カイル＠＠ built this school.
Dad...
Dad...
Normally, a town the size of Alvarna{LF}would never have its own school.{LF}Children are typically home schooled{LF}by their own parents.
I remember when ＠カイル＠＠{LF}wanted to build this school.{LF}We all thought he was crazy.{LF}But if he hadn't...{LF}
We wouldn't have been able to{LF}decipher the tablet.{LF}It's all because of him... {LF}Because of Dad...
We wouldn't have been able to{LF}decipher the tablet.{LF}It's all because of him... {LF}Because of Dad...
It's going to take a little more time to{LF}fully understand the writings. It seems{LF}like no one at the Royal College can{LF}read it, either, but we have you here.
For some reason, you seem to be able{LF}to read this tablet. With your help,{LF}we might become the first people in {LF}ages to read Earthscript.
Wow!
Wow!
You keep finding these amazing{LF}tablets one after the other,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
It almost seems like someone has{LF}been leaving them for you to find.
It looks like we have all of{LF}the pieces of the tablet now.
Barrett!{LF}I've found another piece of the tablet!
Barrett! I've found another piece{LF}of the tablet!
Shouldn't this be all of them?
Shouldn't this be all of them?
Yeah... It looks like we have{LF}all of the pieces of the{LF}tablet now.
Hurry, see if you can read it!
Hurry, see if you can read it!
All right, let me give it a try... 
Hmm...
What?! No, it can't...!
But this here...and this...{LF}No, I can't believe it!
But...it has to be... {LF}It couldn't be anything else... {LF}And if so, this town... 
B-Barrett? What does it say?
B-Barrett? What does it say?
There are still parts of it{LF}that I don't understand.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, can you read{LF}this part here?
Here?{LF}Umm... {LF}It says, "This town."
Here?{LF}Umm... {LF}It says, "This town."
"This town"... {LF}How about here? Can you read this part?
It says..."sealed."{LF}Sealed? What does that mean?
It says..."sealed."{LF}Sealed? What does that mean?
It means something is being sealed away.
What?
What?
It seems that there is much more{LF}to this town than I could have{LF}ever possibly believed.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
A long time ago, this town{LF}was built in order to seal away{LF}one of the Elder Dragons,{LF}Fiersome, the god of fire.{LF}
But that seal would only{LF}last for 1000 years.{LF}Now that seal is starting to break.
Actually, if this tablet is correct,{LF}the seal should have already{LF}broken years ago...
All of those earthquakes that we{LF}had are a sign that the seal is{LF}weakening. Fiersome is rampaging{LF}around somewhere beneath the ground.
What will happen if the seal is{LF}broken?
What will happen if the seal is{LF}broken?
Fiersome is the god of fire and{LF}destruction. It will lay waste to the{LF}world. Then, legend says that the god{LF}of earth, Terrable, will be born anew.
It will signal the rebirth of our{LF}planet...
B-But that means... {LF}We're all going to die!
B-But that means... {LF}We're all going to die!
Not necessarily. In the past,{LF}the Earthmates were able to{LF}command powerful magics and{LF}seal Fiersome away, right?{LF}
According to this tablet,{LF}＠アイテム９＠ is the key to{LF}sealing Fiersome away...
＠アイテム９＠... {LF}So you're saying that we{LF}could use that same magic{LF}to seal him away again?
＠アイテム９＠... {LF}So you're saying that we{LF}could use that same magic{LF}to seal him away again?
Possibly. But, in order for it{LF}to be sealed, it must first{LF}be defeated in battle.
We have to... We have to battle a {LF}dragon god?
We have to... We have to battle a {LF}dragon god?
The sealing spell is written{LF}on this tablet. There's no{LF}time to hesitate.{LF}I will go.
But, Barrett, can you even use magic?
But, Barrett, can you even use magic?
Let me try.
＠アイテム９＠!
......
......
I can't do it. I just don't have{LF}the blood of an Earthmate flowing{LF}in my veins.
Let me give it a try.
Let me give it a try.
＠アイテム９＠!
＠アイテム９＠!
It... It worked!
B-Barrett?! Are you hurt?
B-Barrett?! Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine. It seems like this{LF}magic doesn't deal damage{LF}directly.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
It means that this is support magic.{LF}Once you cast this spell, your{LF}regular attacks will become{LF}stronger.
They will?
They will?
＠アルス＠＠, you must be a descendant{LF}of the Earthmates. When you were able{LF}to read the writing on the stone{LF}tablet, I thought you might be.
When ＠カイル＠＠ lost his memory{LF}and came to this town, that too{LF}must have been because he was born{LF}with the blood of an Earthmate.
Then I have to be the one to go.
Then I have to be the one to go.
You can't be serious! This isn't{LF}anything for a child to do!
This isn't like going to play inside{LF}the dungeons! We're talking about{LF}one of the dragon gods here!
But...if I don't go, who will? If{LF}nobody goes to seal the dragon god,{LF}something awful is going to happen,{LF}isn't it?
But...if I don't go, who will? If{LF}nobody goes to seal the dragon god,{LF}something awful is going to happen,{LF}isn't it?
That... That might be true...{LF}But what if the seal has already{LF}been broken? It could already{LF}be too late.
And if the seal hasn't broken yet, {LF}for whatever reason, then maybe,{LF}just maybe, the seal will{LF}keep holding forever.{LF}
But... 
But...
L-Listen to me! You can't go!{LF}Absolutely not!{LF}Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to hold on to the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ spell, all{LF}right?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, regardless, we don't have{LF}any way to get beneath the city.
It looks like there are still{LF}fragments of the tablet left in{LF}Trieste Forest.
It looks like there are still{LF}fragments of the tablet left in{LF}Blessia Island.
It looks like there are still{LF}fragments of the tablet left in{LF}Messhina Valley.
It looks like there are still{LF}fragments of the tablet left in{LF}the Padova Mountains.
Don't even think about trying to{LF}go seal the dragon god, you got that?
Well, regardless, we don't have{LF}any way to get beneath the city anyway.
(Isn't there any way{LF}to get beneath the city?)
(Isn't there any way{LF}to get beneath the city?)
(But first, I need to get the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ spell back from{LF}Barrett!)
(But first, I need to get the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ spell back from{LF}Barrett!)
Barrett, do you know how to cast{LF}that magic spell that would allow {LF}me to go to the Forest of Beginnings?
Barrett, do you know how to cast{LF}that magic spell that would allow {LF}me to go to the Forest of Beginnings?
Hmmm... I know it's a lot of work,{LF}but I think searching for the {LF}ancient tablet fragments will be faster.
The ancient tablet... 
The ancient tablet... 
Barrett!{LF}Isn't this all of the fragments?
Barrett!{LF}Isn't this all of the fragments?
Yes, it looks like it.
I did it!{LF}Can you read what it says?
I did it!{LF}Can you read what it says?
It says... {LF}"Omni-Gate."
Could that be?
Could that be?
I don't know yet.{LF}It seems to be a type of{LF}teleportation spell.
Yes!
Yes!
But I don't know what it does exactly.{LF}I'll hold onto it for now.
What?!{LF}No... 
What?!{LF}No... 
Teleportation magic is dangerous,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. What if you {LF}transported yourself to another world {LF}and you couldn't make your way home?
Well... 
Well... 
Regardless, I'm going to hold on to it{LF}for the time being. Understood?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Barrett! Look at this tablet!
Barrett! Look at this tablet!
This one has Earthscript on it, too.{LF}If we put all the fragments together,{LF}we might be able to read it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm going to hold onto the{LF}"Omni-Gate" spell for now.{LF}Understood?
＠カイル＠＠ came back?!{LF}Where on earth was he?!{LF}Well, I'm happy for you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
What is it?
Did you have a question about class?
Do you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}take Leonel to be your{LF}husband, to have and to{LF}hold, from this day forward...
...For better, for worse, for richer,{LF}for poorer, in sickness and in health,{LF}to love and to cherish, till death{LF}do you part?
Uh, um...
Uh, um...
Ga ha ha ha! I guess you're too{LF}young to make that kind of promise!
＠アルス＠＠, we're just {LF}trying to play wedding,{LF}right?{LF}
What? We are? Okay, I was worried{LF}for a minute there!
What? We are? Okay, I was worried{LF}for a minute there!
We're still only kids!{LF}We can't get married yet!
You got that right, kid!{LF}Ga ha ha ha!
I promise to love you forever,{LF}＠アルス＠＠... Now you promise,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Hey, both of you...
I promise too, ＠アルス＠＠!
There, it's done!{LF}Ga ha ha ha!
Now we're married!{LF}Ha ha ha!
Hey, both of you...
I know it's just a game,{LF}but I'm starting to feel{LF}kinda embarrassed...
Yeah, kind of, huh?
Anyway, that was fun, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Let's play again some time!
What? I can have it?{LF}Thanks!
I brought what you asked for, Leonel!
I brought what you asked for, Leonel!
Thanks! I knew you could do it,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Now I just have to try to eat it...{LF}Ugh... Just looking at it makes me{LF}feel queasy... I don't know if I{LF}can do this...
You can do it, Leonel!
You can do it, Leonel!
Well, I'll try...
Here, I should thank you.{LF}Please take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Please, I don't need any more... 
Oh, I think your backpack must be full.{LF}Could you get rid of something?
I can have this?{LF}Thanks.
I love these!{LF}Thanks!
I like these!{LF}Thanks!
I like to eat these!{LF}Thanks!
Ughh... {LF}Um, I don't really want that... 
Here, drink this.
Here, drink this.
What is it?{LF}I just need to drink it?
Thanks for playing with me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
What? I can have it?{LF}Thanks!
Here, drink this.
Here, drink this.
Y-Yes, all right.
Um, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}My heart is beating fast{LF}all of a sudden.
That looks delicious!{LF}I'd love to get this on a{LF}special day, like my birthday!
That looks delicious!{LF}I'd love to get this on a{LF}special day, like my birthday!
I can have this? Thanks!{LF}Today's actually my birthday.{LF}It's so nice to get a present!{LF}It looks delicious!
I can have this? Thanks!{LF}Today's actually my birthday.{LF}It's so nice to get a present!{LF}It looks delicious!
I already got a present from you.{LF}I couldn't ask for another one.{LF}Thanks for the thought, though.
I already got a present from you.{LF}I couldn't ask for another one.{LF}Thanks for the thought, though.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
What? I can have it?{LF}Thanks!
It's the start of another week.{LF}I like going to school.
Mana's class is fun, don't you think?{LF}I love her classes.
Don't you wish we could have{LF}class outside on a day like this?
The week's halfway over already.
It's Friday today.{LF}Look, Roy can't sit still{LF}'cause he's thinking of {LF}what to do on the weekend.
It's a brand new week!{LF}Let's try our best, ＠アルス＠＠!
I like going to class because{LF}I get to see all of my friends.
Dad's classes are{LF}a little difficult.
When I get hungry in the morning{LF}it's hard to focus on class.
There's no school tomorrow.{LF}I wonder what I should do.
What class are you good at,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I'm good at cooking.
Don't sleep in too late and miss class!
In the fall I get to try out{LF}all of the recipes I learned{LF}during the rest of the year.
Roy hasn't returned any of the{LF}toys I let him borrow.{LF}I wonder what happened to them.
There's still some empty desks{LF}in the classroom.
I hate how cold it gets in the winter.{LF}I feel like I'm going to sleep in too {LF}late and miss class.
Hey ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I heard that your father was talking{LF}about building a school.{LF}Wouldn't that be great?
When it comes to snowball fights,{LF}I'm no match{LF}for Cammy and Roy!
Snow looks like it should be all puffy{LF}and warm, but really it's just cold.{LF}I think snow would be better if it was{LF}warm.
I get tired when it's this cold out.
Hi, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Make yourself at home.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Are you inviting me to play?
Come on in!{LF}Do you need anything?
Come on in!{LF}If you're not busy, we should play!
Come on in, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I'm glad you're here.
I love my ＠アイテム８＠.{LF}I wish I could get a new one.
When I stay home,{LF}I just end up getting tired.
It's cold outside,{LF}so I'd rather stay in here.
When I go in the bath with Roy,{LF}we always end up roughhousing{LF}and splashing around.
I love baths 'cause it{LF}feels so good when you step out.
I've gotta keep clean.
Baths are so nice in the winter.
The cherry blossoms are so pretty,{LF}aren't they?
It's hot outside the shade.
The fall leaves are so pretty,{LF}aren't they? There's so many colors.
It's so cold out! The town's all{LF}covered in snow!
I like being here 'cause there's{LF}so many people around.
I don't think I could even eat a single{LF}＠アイテム７＠.{LF}I really can't stand them.
The weather really varies{LF}in the fall. It's a real pain sometimes.{LF}
I wonder why the fountain{LF}never freezes over.
The weather in spring is so calm.{LF}I like it.
It's hot outside, ＠アルス＠＠.
The weather can really change easy{LF}in the fall. It's a real pain sometimes.{LF}
It's cold outside, but it's still{LF}fun to play in the snow.
You made it, ＠アルス＠＠!
Let's go stand where we can see better.
I hope we see a shooting star!
Me too!
Tee-hee! I can't wait!
Me neither! I hope see one soon!
There! That was one right there!{LF}Wow, it was soooo pretty!
Yeah, it was really pretty!
It was so sudden that it startled{LF}me, actually!
Hee-hee! Me too!
There's another one!
That one was really pretty, too!
Wow, this is so exciting!
I know!
Tee-hee!
You know, you really do act like{LF}a girl sometimes, Leonel...{LF}
What? You really think so?
But I'm a boy! You shouldn't be{LF}so mean to me!
Ha ha ha! I'm sorry, but you're{LF}not very scary when you're{LF}angry...
I'm guess I'm not very good at{LF}getting mad...
But you're nice. And that's a good{LF}thing, Leonel...
Really...?
Tee-hee!
Yeah, it is a good thing!
Well, we should get home soon.
It's pretty cold out.
Yeah.
Thanks for inviting me out here tonight.{LF}I had fun, ＠アルス＠＠. Hee-hee!
I had fun too, Leonel! I'm glad that{LF}we got to watch the stars together!
Well, goodnight!
Night-night! See you later!
The warm sunlight feels so nice.
Hi, my name's Leonel.
Er, um, nice to meet you.{LF}I'm ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I hope I can make friends{LF}with the girls here.
Er, um, nice to meet you.{LF}I'm ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}It's good to see another girl here.
Um, well, that's nice,{LF}but...I'm a boy.
What?{LF}Sorry! Sorry, I thought you were a girl.
What?{LF}Sorry! Sorry, I thought you were a girl.
No...don't worry about it.{LF}It happens all the time...
Um, my parents are{LF}Barrett and Dorothy.{LF}Remember that, all{LF}right?
Um, my parents are{LF}Barrett and Yue.{LF}Remember that, all{LF}right?
All right. I won't forget,{LF}Leonel.
All right. I won't forget,{LF}Leonel.
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Happy New Year,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}I wonder if everyone's already{LF}gone to look at the flowers.
Yeah.
Do you want to go look at the flowers?
Let's go see the flowers together.
I'm going to take a look around.
Let's go look at the flowers together.{LF}The tree in the{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}is really pretty.
Let's go look at the flowers together.{LF}The tree in the{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}is really pretty.
All right, let's go!
Wait for me at the{LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll be there right away.
All right. See you there.
I love looking at flowers.
Go on ahead to the{LF}＠マップ９＠.{LF}I'll be there right away.
That was fun, ＠アルス＠＠.
The cherry blossoms are so pretty. {LF}I like them a lot. What about you, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Eating Contest.{LF}If you compete, ＠アルス＠＠, {LF}make sure not to overdo it.
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠! I didn't realize{LF}you had it in you!
Oh well, there's always next year.
Today's the start of swimming {LF}season, but I'm not much of {LF}a swimmer.
Today's the Monster Taming Contest.{LF}I want to be friends with monsters too!
Ah, I won! I'm so happy.
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠. I have a ton{LF}of respect for you.
What a shame. Don't let it{LF}get you too down, okay?
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}Do you like dancing?
Yup.
Yup. Hey, Leonel...
Come dance with me.
Do you like dancing?
Is that an invitation?{LF}I'm so happy!| Let's dance!
I'm really happy that you thought{LF}to invite me, but I'm busy... Sorry.
Dancing's so fun! I like it too.
I had fun, ＠アルス＠＠.
Sorry... And you went out of{LF}your way to invite me.
Dancing feels great, doesn't it?
Dancing feels great, doesn't it?
Today's the Big Cook-Off!{LF}I wonder if there will be lots{LF}of yummy food to eat.
Wow!!! I didn't think you{LF}could pull it off!
Well that didn't go so well...
Today's the Adventure Contest!{LF}But if you participate, be sure to{LF}take care of yourself. Adventuring{LF}can be pretty dangerous, you know.
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠! I can't{LF}say I'm surprised though.
Oh well, looks like it{LF}didn't work out.
Today's the Harvest Festival.
I am thankful that I always{LF}have yummy food to eat.
Today's the Monster Contest!{LF}I'm not so good with scary monsters.
That monster totally caught me{LF}off guard!
I think that your monster is really{LF}something, ＠アルス＠＠.
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Aren't shooting stars so pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, I wonder if we'll be{LF}able to see any! Oh, by the{LF}way, Leonel...
Come watch the stars with me!
Are you gonna stay up tonight?
Okay, let's go!|
Let's meet tonight at 9:00 PM{LF}at Falling Star Path!
Uhh, I'm sorry. I'm already{LF}doing something else tonight...
I usually fall asleep as soon{LF}as the sun goes down, so I'm{LF}not sure if I'll be able to make it!
Let's meet at Falling Star Path{LF}at 9:00 PM tonight, okay?
Sorry, I can't go with you.
The shooting stars were so pretty,{LF}weren't they? Thanks for inviting me.
I want to see some shooting stars...
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}It'll be nice if we get to see{LF}some shooting stars.
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}It kind of sounds like fun, doesn't it?
I didn't even think I had{LF}a shot at winning!
You did it! It's so amazing{LF}that you won.
Looks like it didn't work out.
This year's almost over. I{LF}hope we can be friends{LF}next year too, ＠アルス＠＠.
Thanks! You're a lifesaver!{LF}Tee-hee!
I'll at least give it a shot!
Thanks! You're a lifesaver!{LF}Tee-hee!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
So embarrassing,{LF}heeheehee!|
I have a favor to ask you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. Do you think you{LF}could maybe help me out?
Sure, no problem.{LF}What sort of favor?
Sure, no problem.{LF}What sort of favor?
Great! Okay, I want you to{LF}give these ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Roy for me.
I promised to let Roy borrow them{LF}awhile back, but I totally forgot{LF}about it!
So, can you do it?
Of course!
Of course!
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Please give the ＠アイテム９＠ to{LF}Roy for me. Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
You did it! Thanks!
Here's something for your trouble.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You're a lifesaver!{LF}Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Ah, your backpack's full...{LF}Do you think you could take{LF}something out?
I saw your message on the board,{LF}Leonel.
I saw your message on the board,{LF}Leonel.
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠! You made it!{LF}Thanks!
Okay, so here my problem...
There's a fish that I really{LF}don't like to eat, but I was{LF}thinking I should get over{LF}my dislike of it...
So, I was hoping that you{LF}could go and catch a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me. Do you{LF}think you could help me out?
Wow, you're trying to teach{LF}yourself to like ＠アイテム９＠S?{LF}That's so grown up of you,{LF}Leonel!
Wow, you're trying to teach{LF}yourself to like ＠アイテム９＠S?{LF}That's so grown up of you,{LF}Leonel!
All right. I'll catch one for you.
All right. I'll catch one for you.
Thanks!
I think you can catch{LF}a them on Blessia Island.
Thanks again!
I want you to catch me{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠.
I think you can catch{LF}them on Blessia Island.{LF}Thanks!
Well, I should give you something{LF}in return. Here you go.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
Ah, your backpack's full...{LF}Do you think you could take{LF}something out?
I saw your message on the{LF}board, Leonel.
I saw your message on the{LF}board, Leonel.
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠! About that...
Could give this ＠アイテム９＠ to{LF}Orland for me?
I was having trouble understanding{LF}something at school, and he helped{LF}me out, so I wanted to thank him.
But... I'm kind of too embarrassed{LF}to give it to him myself...
So, I was wondering if you could{LF}maybe go and give it to him for{LF}me.
Please?
You get embarrassed pretty easily,{LF}don't you, Leonel? Don't worry.{LF}I'll do it.
You get embarrassed pretty easily,{LF}don't you? Don't worry, Leonel.{LF}It's no problem. I'll do it!
Tee-hee! Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Okay, here you go.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Ah, your backpack's full...{LF}Do you think you could take{LF}something out?
Don't forget to give the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Orland for me!
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
So did you give it to him?{LF}Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
Heh, it's no biggie.
It's no biggie! Do you collect{LF}＠アイテム９＠S or something?
Yeah. I collect them with Roy.
So, d-do you think Orland liked{LF}it?
Um, yeah! He seemed to like it{LF}a lot!
Um, yeah! He seemed to like it{LF}a lot!
That's good!
Ah, I almost forgot! Here's{LF}something for you!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Tee-hee! Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠!
I saw your message on the board.
I saw your message on the board.
Ah, you made it, ＠アルス＠＠.
What's up?
What's up?
Well, something's been bothering{LF}me...
People always tell me that I don't{LF}look like a boy...
But I am a boy! What about{LF}me makes me seem like a girl?
You want me to be honest?
Hmmm...
You want me to be honest?
It might be how you look...
How I look? Hmm, maybe...{LF}But what should I do?
Well, why don't you try making{LF}a scary face?
Well, why don't you try making{LF}a scary face?
A scary face?
That can't be it!
Yeah! See, you always look so{LF}friendly, Leonel! Maybe you should{LF}try the opposite, and look fierce!
Hmmm... Like...this?
Is anyone else coming?
Ha ha ha! That's not scary at all,{LF}Leonel!
Really?
I tried so hard...
Hmmm...
I guess it didn't really work.{LF}But I think I like your friendly{LF}face better anyway, Leonel!
Really?
Not...like that, though.
Yeah, this version of you is{LF}a lot easier to talk to.
Tee-hee! Well, if you think so,{LF}then that's the important thing!
Not...like that, though, right?
Yeah! So don't worry about it,{LF}Leonel!
Okay!
Well, thanks for listening{LF}to me, ＠アルス＠＠!
Not...like that, though, right?
No problem!
Tee-Hee! Okay, see you later!
Ah, ＠アルス＠＠.
I saw the board. What do you{LF}need to talk to me about?
Well, okay, um, about that...
There's something I've been{LF}wanting to talk to you about...
What is it?
Well, the truth is, I... I...{LF}like you, ＠アルス＠＠.
So, um, I was wondering what{LF}you thought about me?
Um, well, that's very sudden, and{LF}I guess, um, I think that...
I like you too, Leonel.
I like you...as a friend.
I like you too, Leonel...
Hee-hee, this is a little{LF}embarrassing...
Wow, I'm so happy... Okay, let's{LF}go get married!
Huh? Married? Aren't we a little{LF}young?
Maybe a little bit, but we can still{LF}do it! Come on, let's go to the{LF}church!
I like you...as a friend,{LF}Leonel...
Oh... Okay...
Well, I'm really happy that we're{LF}friends, ＠アルス＠＠!
Me too!
The spring feels so nice and warm.
So...hot... This heat is{LF}never going to end.
The fall feels kind of{LF}lonely, doesn't it?
It looks like the snow has painted{LF}the ground white.
Why does everyone think I'm a girl{LF}when they first meet me? That's{LF}just silly!
Things like ＠アイテム９＠ and {LF}＠アイテム６＠ are so sweet{LF}and yummy.
I like them a lot.
These days I've been helping{LF}collect materials for workshop class.
My dad's real tough, though... {LF}I'm so worn out.
I'm really happy that{LF}we're friends, ＠アルス＠＠.
Let's stay friends!
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠, I can't{LF}believe you beat those{LF}monsters in the forest!
If it were me, I know{LF}I'd scream my head off{LF}and run away.
Wow! You can even beat{LF}the monsters out on{LF}Blessia Island.
You just keep getting stronger{LF}and stronger, ＠アルス＠＠. But{LF}I'm a little worried about you.
You just got so strong{LF}all of a sudden!{LF}I can't even pretend{LF}to act like you anymore.
You can handle anything, ＠アルス＠＠.
I really respect you.
It's so great that your dad{LF}came back, ＠アルス＠＠!
You always look so healthy, ＠アルス＠＠.
You always look so healthy, ＠アルス＠＠.
Whoa! This is more delicious than{LF}I could have ever imagined. This is{LF}surely an unprecedented discovery!

Ah, you're the one who's new{LF}in town, right? This is a{LF}little out of the blue, but{LF}do you like cooking, ＠カイル＠＠?
Cooking? Well, not that much,{LF}to be honest...
Oh! You're missing out{LF}on the best part of life!
A good life starts with good food!{LF}Remember that!
O-Okay... Got it...
Good! Please start learning{LF}more about cooking tomorrow!
Also, if you find anything{LF}tasty, please let me try it!{LF}I'll be waiting!
O-Okay...
Ah, it's springtime.
It's the time to eat loooots of{LF}cabbage to make your stomach{LF}gooood and strong!
Ah, it's summertime.
It's the time to eat loooots of{LF}pumpkin to make your whole{LF}belly feel grrrreat!
Ah, it's fall.

Come, Father, while it's still hot.
Mmmmmm...
Well, the truth is that earlier I{LF}got so hungry, I went a bit overboard{LF}and gobbled down enough{LF}＠アイテム８＠ for 12 people.
But, but, but still!
Now that you've put this ＠アイテム９＠{LF}in front of me, my stomach has just{LF}started rumbling! I wonder{LF}why that is?!
I guess it's impossible for me{LF}to ever feel too full for a dish{LF}that smells this wonderful!
Okay, I'll just have a bite.
And here I go!

Ahhh, this feels like a dream.{LF}But no, it's real...

Good day.
How are you feeling, ＠カイル＠＠?
How're the field's treating you?{LF}What about mining, is that coming{LF}along? Have you been fishing much?
Hmm, well...
Everything's going pretty well.
Hold on, Byron, that's not{LF}how you open a conversation!
Oh, forgive my rudeness.
Byron is just hard on young people.
Byron always acts like this{LF}towards ambitious youngsters{LF}like yourself. He's not actually{LF}in a bad mood.
Well, it looks like things are going{LF}well for everyone in this town!
Yup! More or less.
Ooooh, could it be...＠カイル＠＠?
Won't you joooooin us?
Were you all eating?
Sometimes the three of {LF}us all eat together like this.
Kind of like a breakfast meeting...
Hmm? Maybe not?
Well, Egan is always so{LF}busy talking that he{LF}doesn't really concentrate{LF}on his foooood.
Hahaha, that's exactly right.
I guess it's fun to just sit{LF}down and have a meal{LF}together.
Ooooh, could it be...＠カイル＠＠?
We were just in the middle{LF}of a tasting, you see.
Herman ordered some regional{LF}wines from the homeland.
Ooooh, could it be...＠カイル＠＠?
Won't you joooooin us?
Were you all eating?
Sometimes the three of {LF}us all eat together like this.
But Egan's always{LF}so busy talking that he doesn't{LF}really pay attention to his foooood.
Oh my, all of this wonderful{LF}food in front of me and here {LF}I've been just chattering away.
Anything I leave would just{LF}be an insult to Ceci.
Yes it would!{LF}So eaaat up, Egan.
I guess it's fun to just sit{LF}down and have a meal{LF}together, hahaha.

And if you win, that special someone's{LF}opinion of you will no doubt go up!
What's more, the winner will receive{LF}a faaaabulous prize!
So how about it?!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, you thinking of{LF}competing, too?
Don't even bother. I'm competing,{LF}so the outcome has already been{LF}decided.
There's no way anyone can beat me!
I'm the minister, after all!{LF}Do the words divine blessing{LF}mean anything to you?{LF}Ahahahahahaha.
Don't be an idiot!{LF}If you look up "competitive eating" in{LF}the dictionary, you'll find my picture{LF}right there.
Hmph. I'll bet your jaws will be so{LF}tired from all that boasting that{LF}you'll barely be able to take two{LF}bites!
Oh, don't worry about me!
I can take twenty bites in{LF}one second! My teeth are three times{LF}stronger than anyone else!
There's no way anyone's gonna{LF}top me. I'm gonna win, and that{LF}prize is as good as Mana's.
No amount of divine intervention is{LF}going to help you, Gordon!{LF}Ahahahahaha.
But you're competing too, ＠カイル＠＠?
I like your spunk, kid, but I'm not{LF}gonna go easy on ya!
I'm in!
Never mind...
Now that's what I'm talking{LF}about, ＠カイル＠＠!
Now that's what I'm talking{LF}about, ＠アルス＠＠!
Okay, and now for the ruuuuules.
When I say "Start!", press the {LF}A Button rapidly as fast as you{LF}can until I say "Stop!".

You beat me, ＠カイル＠＠!
First off, congratulations!{LF}You did well, ＠カイル＠＠.
But still, I never imagined that{LF}you'd actually beat two serious{LF}eaters like us!
You're really shaping up to{LF}be quite something.
For sure!
On top of that, Douglas,{LF}it looks like you haven't{LF}improved since you were{LF}a little brat!
What does that mean?!{LF}Don't let the fact that you won{LF}second place go to your head there.{LF}For a priest, you're not very humble!
Is someone a sore loser?{LF}Seems like you're getting{LF}pretty girly in your old age{LF}there, Douglas.
Do you ever shut up?!
Ahahahahaha!

Ahahahah! What a shame, Gordon.{LF}Your defeat was decided from{LF}the moment I entered, though!
What are you talking about?{LF}You took first place?{LF}Well, that's great...
Huh?
You see, I was only competing to{LF}help urge on ＠カイル＠＠'s growth!
I could care less about{LF}the actual competition!
Don't give me that! You{LF}competed because you{LF}wanted to win!
Hmph! I can't let you{LF}talk like that, and I'm not{LF}going to listen to another word {LF}that comes out of your mouth!
Uh, excuse me, but...Douglas,{LF}didn't you only compete because{LF}you wanted to make Mana happy?
Exactly! No part of my entering{LF}this competition was selfish!
It was all because I wanted to{LF}see Mana's smiling face!
At least you understand me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠, unlike Gordon here...
H-h-hahaha.
Hmmmm, so that's how it is.{LF}At least you'll say that in{LF}front of ＠カイル＠＠.

What about you, Gordon?{LF}Looks like you weren't so blessed{LF}after all!
Hmm, Douglas, a little vain, are we?
And to put other people down just{LF}to build up your own sense of{LF}pride... How shameful.
Pride comes before the fall, you know.
You need to learn how to be humble{LF}and gracious in victory, Douglas.
But do not fear, you poor little lamb.{LF}I'll shepherd your spirit along the{LF}path to righteousness!
Oh lord, please forgive Douglas,{LF}for he cannot see that he is a thick-{LF}skulled nincompoop who only won{LF}because he got lucky...
Ahhhhhhhh, cut that out!{LF}Sheesh! You're worse than my in-laws!

Really, Jake. Can't you at least{LF}lose with some dignity? That monster{LF}I tamed had more class than you.
Just know that I'm gonna do something{LF}to make up for this humiliation!
Um...well...
Maybe I just got lucky...
Or maybe you should try practicing{LF}a little more...

"Maido!"{LF}
It's a way for merchants to {LF}say goodbye to a customer{LF}who's just made a purchase.{LF}
Really?{LF}Got it!
All right, then, let's try it out!{LF}Find your mother, and ask for{LF}a piece of candy. When she gives{LF}it to you, say "Maido," alright?

Oh my, ＠カイル＠＠...{LF}What should I do with this?
Oh my, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}What should I do with this?
I can have this?{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
This is from Julia? Thank you very{LF}much for delivering it to me.
Please remember to tell Julia thank{LF}you for me!
I will!
I will!
Isn't this the{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}I asked Mana to give me?
And, who are you?
I'm ＠カイル＠＠.
My name is Rosalind de{LF}Sainte-Coquille.
My brother and my father will{LF}probably cause you trouble,{LF}but be nice to them.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
They are good people, just... {LF}easily misunderstood.{LF}Please try to be patient with them.{LF}{LF}
I will.
Well, it was nice meeting you.{LF}Thanks again for the delivery.{LF}Don't forget to tell Mana the same.
I won't forget.
Ah, this is the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}I asked Mana to give me.
Thank you for delivering it to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Also, remember to tell that Mana{LF}I said thanks, all right?
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you??
Ah... You found the{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}What a beautiful fragrance.
It's very calming.
Did you know that the scent{LF}of this flower can even cure insomnia?
It can? I didn't know that.{LF}(Is she having trouble sleeping?)
Yes, it can.
Well then, here is your payment.{LF}Please take it.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'm so happy that someone like you{LF}has come to this town....
The bulletin board it is only helpful{LF}if people use it.{LF}If nobody stops to read it, it{LF}may as well just be a piece of wood.
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}This is exactly what I was looking for.
You... haven't been hurt, right?
I'm just glad that you're alright.
Well then, here is your payment.{LF}Please take it.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Please take this{LF}＠アイテム８＠{LF}as well.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}There isn't any room in your backpack.
Please make room for one item{LF}and talk to me again.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
This ＠アイテム８＠{LF}is a tool that can be used to{LF}gather items from monsters {LF}that you've befriended.
To be more precise...
You can gather honey{LF}from pet Hornets and{LF}Queen Bees,{LF}
and eggs from Cluckadoodles.
To use it, first press the L Button{LF}and the B Button at the same time.{LF}This will display the{LF}Quick Equip: Tool menu.{LF}
Highlight your new{LF}＠アイテム８＠{LF}and press the B Button.
Doing so will equip your{LF}＠アイテム８＠{LF}in your right hand.
With the ＠アイテム８＠{LF}equipped, walk next to your{LF}pet Hornet or Queen Bee,
and press the B Button.{LF}Then you'll gather{LF}honey from your monster.
You can gather eggs from your{LF}Cluckadoodle in the same way.
Understood?
You can use that{LF}＠アイテム８＠{LF}to periodically gather{LF}eggs and honey from
monsters that you've{LF}befriended in the dungeons.
You can sell those products,{LF}or, if you prefer, you can keep{LF}them to use in your own cooking.
I hope that you'll get a lot of{LF}use out of that gift!
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you.
Thank you.{LF}This is perfect! Now that I have it...
Rosalind, what are you going to use{LF}that ＠アイテム９＠ for?
...{LF}Yes, I think I can tell you now.
Um... This is embarrassing to say, but... {LF}I...ah... {LF}I'm the shortest person in the family.{LF}
I've been wearing high heels{LF}to seem taller than I really am.
You've been keeping it a secret?
Yes, I have.{LF}But these shoes, as you can see,{LF}are getting quite worn out.{LF}
Because this pair is almost{LF}ready to fall apart, I've {LF}been trying to find a replacement.
Unfortunately, this style of heels{LF}is no longer being produced.
It started to look like I{LF}would never be able to buy{LF}another pair from a store.
Finally, I went to Byron and {LF}asked him to use his connections{LF}to find a collector willing to{LF}part with one of her pairs...
But the one collector who is willing{LF}to part with her pair is asking a{LF}ridiculously high price.
I see.
But... If I could just get my hands{LF}on the right materials, I could repair{LF}these shoes myself.
You could?
That's when I thought of a new plan.
If I put requests for the materials{LF}on the town's bulletin board.{LF}I knew that you could get those{LF}materials for me, ＠カイル＠＠.
I was sure that I could repair{LF}my shoes with your help!
And the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}was one of those materials, right?
Yes, and thanks to your strength,{LF}I've finally been able to get that{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
What happened with the{LF}collector you contacted?
I've already sent her a letter{LF}turning down her offer.
Thankfully, she was understanding,{LF}and accepted my sudden cancellation {LF}without objection.
I'm sure you've guessed by now,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, haven't you?
You mean... {LF}That was the secret document {LF}you had me deliver to Byron? 
Correct.
Of course. You had it all figured out,{LF}didn't you?
Yes, I did.
But my plan only worked because{LF}you came through for me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm glad I could count on you.
Oh, n-no, it was nothing.{LF}You're making me embarrassed.
Please, take this ＠数字９＠G{LF}as a token of my gratitude.
You got: ＠数字９＠G!
Now it's time for me to patch{LF}up these shoes.
I think I might add some{LF}flowers to the design.{LF}It should complement the {LF}feminine feel of them.
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you.
That's incredible, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I can't believe you found one!{LF}And so quickly, too!{LF}You're really amazing!
Ha ha ha!{LF}You're embarrassing me!
You're cute when you're embarrassed...{LF}
...{LF}...{LF}...
Ha ha!{LF}I've left both of us speechless.
Ahem!
Well then, back to the matter at hand.{LF}Good job, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Please take your reward,{LF}＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Thanks. I'd better get going...
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Don't leave yet.
Wait just a second.
What? Alright.{LF}(I wonder what she wants...)
...
Rosalind, that's...
All done!
W-What is...
This is my new recipe.
It's the impossible-to-resist{LF}"Golden Cabbage Salad!"
I made it with the GOLD CABBAGE{LF}that you brought me.
It's my crowning achievement! {LF}Truly the product of our teamwork!
Go ahead, try it!
It looks delicious!{LF}I can't wait to taste it.
*munch* *munch*
*munch* *munch*
*gulp!*
Mmm... It's absolutely delicious.
It's...It's...
It's the best salad ever! I don't{LF}think anyone has ever tasted{LF}a better salad!
I could eat it every day{LF}and not grow tired of it.{LF}In fact, I really do wish{LF}I could eat it every day!
Ha ha! You really like it that much?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠!
That gives me an idea!{LF}I can use the leftover cabbage{LF}to make cole slaw.
This is "De Sainte-Coquille{LF}Cole Slaw."
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
Oh, a ＠アイテム９＠?!{LF}Hurry, let's give it to my father!
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠. Nice work!
Here's your payment of ＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠. Nice work!
Here's your payment of ＠数字９＠G.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
A-A bouquet of Geschule roses!{LF}What a fiery crimson color!{LF}They're beautiful!
This...This is like a dream come true.
Rosalind!
!!!
Will you marry me?
＠カイル＠＠...{LF}Do you...
Do you love me?
I do.
More than life itself... {LF}
I love you!
Yes, I feel the same way.{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I will marry you.
Thanks.{LF}Come here, my darling.
Rosalind...
You're my queen.
＠カイル＠＠...
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
I am thankful for your kind words,{LF}but I still don't know how I feel.
I can't keep these.
Thank you for your kind words,{LF}but aren't you already married?{LF}Polygamy is illegal, you know!
Didn't you know, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I'm already married.
Thank you.{LF}If you'd given this to me{LF}on my birthday, I'd really{LF}have liked it.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}but I'd hoped to get{LF}this on my birthday.{LF}
Thank you!{LF}You remembered my birthday!
I'm absolutely delighted!
You're giving me that{LF}＠アイテム９＠?{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}How sweet of you.
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}If I get too many of these,{LF}they start to lose their meaning...
Thank you,{LF}but one birthday present is enough.
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}You're giving this to me?{LF}Well...thank you.
I'll give it a taste.
＠カイル＠＠...
...{LF}...
Thank you.
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}You're giving this to me?{LF}Well...thank you.
I'll give it a taste.
How is it?{LF}Do you like it?
...Yes, very much...
...{LF}...
Oh... I'm starting to feel warm...
And my heart is pounding...{LF}What's come over me?
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
This...isn't really... 
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
That's my favorite!
Thank you!
This...isn't really... 
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Umm... Thank you?
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
You're giving this to me,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Thank you...
Hello there. My name is Rosalind{LF}de Sainte-Coquille.
Hi, I'm ＠カイル＠＠.
Nice to meet you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}My brother and father might cause{LF}you a bit of a headache, but,{LF}please, be nice to them.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Don't get me wrong... They're good{LF}people, but...a bit misunderstood.{LF}Please, try to be patient with them.
Okay, I'll keep that in mind!
Thank you! Well, I'll see you{LF}later, ＠カイル＠＠.
See you later, Rosalind!
The weather in the spring can be{LF}so pleasant that sometimes I just{LF}start staring off into the distance.
It's important to open your windows in{LF}the summertime to let the breeze pass{LF}through. If you don't, it will get too{LF}hot and stuffy inside.
When I look at the beautiful colors{LF}of the autumn leaves, I start feeling{LF}like redecorating the colors of my{LF}room to match the season.
In the winter, you have to be careful{LF}to close all of your windows tight,{LF}or you'll let all the warm air escape.
I've done everything I could.{LF}The rest is up to fate.
Now we can be seen{LF}out on dates in public.
I think it's about time for you{LF}to graduate from the bulletin board.
Cooking with spring vegetables{LF}is my specialty!
On a hot day like this,{LF}I like to prepare a simple, light meal{LF}to help everyone cool off.
In our wine rack, {LF}we even have wine made from{LF}grapes grown right here in Alvarna.
A nice hot bowl of soup is{LF}perfect for warming up on a{LF}cold day like today.
I make a habit of bathing in the{LF}warm rays of the sun in the{LF}morning. It really makes me feel{LF}awake and refreshed.
You should try it sometime!
When I was a young child, {LF}I would often play outside {LF}with my brother.{LF}
When I came home,{LF}I'd be covered in sunburns,{LF}as red as a beet.{LF}I miss those days.
In most places, summer is typically{LF}the hurricane season. But here in{LF}Alvarna, storms can come any time{LF}of the year. Be careful!
The whole world looks different{LF}when it's blanketed in snow.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.
Well, speak of the devil.
H-Hello.
We were just talking about{LF}how many blisters you must {LF}have on your hands, ＠カイル＠＠.
You were?
I figured you must have at least ten!
Well, since you're here,{LF}we might as well see for ourselves.{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Your hand, please.
Oh, there's only one.
It's true.{LF}He's got one right on the{LF}base of his middle finger.
Let me touch it!
Me too!
Um, m-me too.
Hey, that tickles!
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}How long have you been there?
Hey, were you eavesdropping on us?
...
I didn't even notice you there.
You were all so caught up in{LF}your conversation that I {LF}didn't want to intrude.
What? {LF}You don't need to worry about that!
Well you know boisterous us women{LF}can get when we're talking.
It has to be difficult for a guy{LF}to walk up and try talking to us.
Isn't it, ＠カイル＠＠?
What what what?{LF}What's boisterous mean?{LF}Rosalind, you're using{LF}big words again.
You haven't heard that word before?
It means...
(It looks like they've{LF}forgotten about me again.)
...
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Come here for a minute.
Julia's been tying together{LF}blades of grass to make us necklaces.
Look look look!{LF}All three of us are wearing one!
Even Dorothy's got one on.
...
Those look nice.{LF}I want one too!
Julia, you should make{LF}one for ＠カイル＠＠{LF}next time.
Alright.{LF}Next time, I'll have one just for you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thanks!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.
It's freezing out today, isn't it?
Yeah, that's why we're sticking{LF}close together. {LF}We're warming each other up! 
You should join us,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Um.. Ha ha ha.
N-No...{LF}I'd better get going.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you're blushing!
What's wrong,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
...
As the warm spring sunlight {LF}passes through the stained {LF}glass, it makes wonderful {LF}colors and patterns on the floor.
Isn't it divine?
Whenever I'm feeling troubled, I come{LF}to church. Just being here makes me{LF}feel better.
I think Gordon is a good man. He{LF}may be an unconventional priest, but{LF}I know that everything he says{LF}comes from his heart.
When I'm in church is the only time{LF}I feel truly safe. I just feel...{LF}protected.
Every week, I ask Alicia for a special{LF}flower reading. She can look at flowers{LF}to determine my luck for the week.
Does that surprise you?
It shouldn't. I'm interested in all{LF}sorts of things. I think there's a lot{LF}more to fortune-telling than most{LF}people think.
Our maid, Cecilia,{LF}is attentive and thoughtful.
She is a woman of impeccable manners.
You probably know this already,{LF}but she's a child of the forest--{LF}an elf.
Elves are distinguished by their{LF}large, pointed ears.
When I was a young child,{LF}I used to be captivated by those ears.
I kept pestering my father{LF}to make my ears longer!
Ha ha ha!{LF}I don't think even Herman{LF}could make that wish come true.
Ha ha, no, not even he could.
The swords and spears that{LF}Tanya forges are really{LF}top-notch, right?
Oh, hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!
H-Hello...
I'm very sorry,{LF}but we're in the middle {LF}of  something right now.{LF}Could you come back later?
And then, Dorothy...
...{LF}(They look pretty busy.)
Oh, hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!
H-Hello...
What are you all doing here?
Well, it's hot outside!
We're staying in here to cool off.
I feel like I'm going{LF}to burn up out there!
Now that you mention it,{LF}it's nice and cool in here.
Isn't it?
Oh, hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}which do you like better,{LF}cats or dogs?
Hmm... I'd have to say...
Dogs.
Cats.
Woolies.
I like dogs the best.
You're the same as me!
What?{LF}I think cats are the best.
Hey, I like both of them.{LF}If I absolutely had to choose,{LF}I'd probably pick dogs, that's all.
I like cats the best.
Yay! Me too!
Oh, really?{LF}That's unfortunate.
Hey, I like both of them.{LF}If I absolutely had to choose,{LF}I'd probably pick cats, that's all.
There's only one clear answer!{LF}I like woolies!
!!!
!!!
!!!
W-Woolies?{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
That's cheating!{LF}Nobody could resist the {LF}cuteness of a wooly.
Oh, hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!
H-Hello...
Listen to this,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Julia and Dorothy are saying{LF}that my cakes don't taste{LF}as good as they used to.
Well, I'm sorry,{LF}but it's the truth!
Ah, but, th-they're still, um,{LF}really good, Rosalind.
No!{LF}If my cakes are getting worse,{LF}I have to do something about it!
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I want you to take a taste for yourself.
Hmm... Let me see.
That looks delicious!{LF}Let me have a bite.
*munch* *munch*
T-This...
It's really good!
It seems normal to me.
That's right! Look at that, everyone!{LF}＠カイル＠＠'s {LF}taste buds can't lie.
But since he hasn't tasted my cake{LF}before, he can't say if it's gotten{LF}worse or not, can he?
What?{LF}So we still haven't gotten anywhere?
W-When you put it like that...{LF}No, we haven't.
A-Anyway, for now I'll just be{LF}satisfied to hear{LF}＠カイル＠＠{LF}compliment my cake.
It seems... normal?{LF}It's taste is... normal?{LF}Economy class normal?{LF}Mass-produced normal?{LF}
What's become of me?{LF}M-My cake is just like some {LF}plain old pre-packaged cake,{LF}is that what you're saying?
I-I'm feeling dizzy.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Rosalind.{LF}Hello, Ray.{LF}What are you two doing?
What does it look like?{LF}We're on a date.
!!!
What?
Ha ha ha, I'm just kidding.
!!!
Ha ha ha.{LF}You almost had me fooled{LF}for a minute there.
...{LF}...{LF}...
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Rosalind.{LF}Hello, Ray.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
I didn't catch you{LF}in the middle of a date, did I?
!!!
...
Ha ha ha!{LF}Sorry, it's not like me {LF}to joke like that.
It's true.{LF}We're in the middle of a date.
!!!
What?
Ha ha ha, I'm just kidding.
!!!!!!
Ha ha ha.{LF}You almost had me fooled{LF}for a minute there.
...{LF}...{LF}...
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Rosalind.{LF}Hello, Ray.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
Um...{LF}What are you two doing?
...{LF}...
You're not...
D-
Da-
Dat-...
!!!
Data.
!!!!!!
Data?
Yes, data.{LF}We're gathering air samples{LF}from around the town.
Really?{LF}Why air samples?
The mayor, Byron, asked us to{LF}compare the amount of pollutants{LF}inside the town with the air{LF}out in the countryside.
He's going to use our data to help{LF}decide how best to improve the {LF}air quality in Alvarna.
I-I see.{LF}So that's it, huh?{LF}For a moment there, {LF}I almost got the wrong idea.
??{LF}The wrong idea about what?
Oh, nothing. Ha ha ha ha.{LF}It's nothing!{LF}Ha ha ha ha, right, Ray?
...{LF}...{LF}...
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Rosalind.{LF}Hello, Ray.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.
You probably want to know{LF}what Rosalind and I are doing,{LF}don't you?
What?!{LF}Well, um, yes, actually...
We're on a d-
We just happened to pass {LF}by on the street, that's all.
!!!!!!
R-Really?
Yes. That and nothing more.
O-Oh.{LF}Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha...
Sometimes I listen to the sound{LF}of the ocean to help myself relax.
Somewhere out there, over the horizon...{LF}There's another world.{LF}A land much different than ours.
Isn't it mysterious?
The benches along the docks are{LF}constantly exposed to the sea breeze,{LF}and they can get quite damp.
If you sit down without looking,{LF}your pants could get all wet.
Be careful!
Sometimes, when I'm standing on the{LF}pier, staring out into the ocean, I {LF}get old sea shanties stuck in my head.{LF}
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Rosalind...
What is it?
I'm sorry!{LF}Something's come up,{LF}and I have to cancel our talk.
Well... ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Something's come up?
Yes.
Well, I don't know what it could be,{LF}but I'm sure it must be important.
I understand.{LF}Thank you for coming to{LF}tell me, at least.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Rosalind...
What is it?
I'm sorry!{LF}Something's come up,{LF}and I have to cancel our talk.
Well... ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Something's come up?
Yes.
Well, I don't know what it could be,{LF}but I'm sure it must be important.
I understand.{LF}Thank you for coming to{LF}tell me, at least.
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
Rosalind...
What is it?
I'm sorry!{LF}Something's come up,{LF}and I have to cancel our talk.
Well... ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Something's come up?
Yes.
Well, I don't know what it could be,{LF}but I'm sure it must be important.
I understand.{LF}Thank you for coming to{LF}tell me, at least.
Since we're going out now,{LF}we'll have plenty of other{LF}chances to go on a date, right?
Of course we will!
Good.{LF}I'll talk to you later.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what's wrong?
＠カイル＠＠!
Sorry to keep you waiting, Rosalind.
Please, give me your hand.{LF}Allow me to escort you to{LF}a place with a better view.
Well...that's nice of you.{LF}If you insist... {LF}
(Rosalind's hand is as cold as ice.)
I'm sorry I was so late.{LF}Your hands are freezing.
Don't worry about it...{LF}My hands will warm up in yours.
See, they are warmer already.
Yeah... They are.
...
...
...{LF}...
...{LF}...
............{LF}............{LF}............
............{LF}............{LF}............
............{LF}............{LF}...＠カイル＠＠... 
............{LF}............{LF}(Wh-What's going on?)
Kiss her.
Hmm, maybe that's moving too fast.
Okay, time to kiss!
Hmm, maybe that's moving too fast.
Okay!
Hmm, maybe that's moving too fast.
R-Rosalind!
Ah!{LF}Look at that!
Hm?
Woooooow!{LF}I've never seen this many{LF}shooting stars before!
Y-Y-Yeah, wow!{LF}Me neither.
I feel like I'm watching a whole group{LF}of shooting stars fall. Like they're{LF}all connected somehow.
Me too.
So beautiful.{LF}You can really just{LF}lose yourself in them.
Yeah...
(Haha... Looks like I blew the kiss...)
(But whatever. I mean, it seems{LF}like she's having a really good time.)
Well, it's getting pretty cold, so{LF}why don't we head home?
Okay!|
Ah! Another shooting star!
Really? Where?!
Look! Right there!
Ah, I see it!
*mwah*
!!!
(Did she just...?)
 ＠カイル＠＠, you gave me a{LF}better evening than I could have{LF}ever possibly wanted.
Take that as my thanks to you.|
Okay... thanks.
So, let's call it a night.{LF}See you tomorrow.
Sweet dreams.
You too.
Good morning.
Hello. Good afternoon.
Good evening.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello. Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How's life at the farm?
Hello. Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How's life at the farm?
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How's life at the farm?
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm really happy to see you.
Hello. Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm really happy to see you.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm really happy to see you.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
I don't know what it is, {LF}but I'm always happy when I{LF}get to see your face.
Hello. Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.
I don't know what it is, {LF}but I'm always happy when I{LF}get to see your face.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
I don't know what it is, {LF}but I'm always happy when I{LF}get to see your face.
Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hello. Good afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Try not to stay up too late.
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I hope next year is just as nice.
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I'll be praying that this year{LF}proves wonderful for you.
It's like a {LF}cherry blossom blizzard{LF}out here, isn't it?
Uhh...{LF}I guess so?
The way the wind whips the cherry{LF}blossoms from the trees and sends{LF}the petals dancing through the air... {LF}it's like a warm, fragrant snowstorm.
And I think the cherry blossoms{LF}are even more beautiful this year{LF}than they were last year.
Hey, Rosalind...
Yes?
Want to go see the flowers with me?
Ever wonder how the flowers taste?
The cherry blossoms are really{LF}in full bloom this year.
Ah, are you inviting me?
Well, I have no reason to say no.{LF}I humbly accept your invitation.
So, how about we meet at{LF}＠マップ９＠?
If you want to invite me, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}maybe you should stop trying to{LF}talk to all those other girls.
Hmm...{LF}I've never really thought about it.
The cherry blossoms are really{LF}blossoming this year.
I'll be heading to {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}a little early.
Attending the Flower Festival{LF}with you let me experience it{LF}from a new perspective. Thank {LF}you for inviting me.
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}Make sure to go and see the{LF}flowers, ＠アルス＠＠!
Congratulations on winning the{LF}Eating Contest.
I feel like I'm finally learning your{LF}true potential.
Looks like the Eating Contest{LF}didn't work out too well for you{LF}this year.
But I know you can't stand{LF}losing... So you'll get your{LF}revenge next year, right?
I'll be rooting for you.
Douglas won this year, right? And{LF}didn't Gordon participate too?{LF}Not much you can do when you're{LF}up against those two.
Gordon won this year, right? And{LF}didn't Douglas participate too? 
There's really not much you can do{LF}when you're up against those two,{LF}is there?
Today's the Eating Contest.
I think this is the day of the year{LF}that my father looks forward to most.{LF}He loves to see other people get as{LF}excited about food as he does!
Today's the Eating Contest.{LF}How about you try your hand{LF}at it too, ＠アルス＠＠.
Congratulations!{LF}Looks like you're definitely{LF}not one of those picky children.
What a shame. Oh well, {LF}eating too much will give{LF}you a stomachache anyhow.
Today's the start of swimming season.{LF}I'm not a very good swimmer, but...
When I see how excited Julia and{LF}them all are, I can't help but{LF}look forward to it!
Swimming season starts today.{LF}I must say, you look very happy{LF}about this, ＠アルス＠＠.
Well done, ＠カイル＠＠, although{LF}I can't say I'm surprised. I hope you'll{LF}let me hear all about your adventures{LF}sometime.
Ahh, so my brother won this year?{LF}That really came out of the blue...
Honestly, I think it's probably better{LF}for a person to fail every now and{LF}then than to think he's invincible.
So please try and treat this as{LF}a learning experience.
Ahh, so my brother won this year?{LF}That really came out of the blue...
You competed this year mostly{LF}out of curiosity, right?
If you spend the next year training{LF}you'll definitely be able to win.
The Monster Taming Contest{LF}really tests how far you've come{LF}as a monster trainer.{LF}
A Monster Taming Contest...
It's pretty dangerous so I{LF}think it might be better if you{LF}don't participate, ＠アルス＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠... {LF}Honestly, I'm really happy that you{LF}won, but you really should stop doing{LF}this kind of stuff.
Congratulations.{LF}But still, don't overdo it.
 ＠アルス＠＠, I'm asking you{LF}as a favor to me to stop doing{LF}such dangerous things.
 ＠アルス＠＠... please stop doing{LF}these sorts of things before you{LF}wind up with permanent consequences.
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}Have you decided on a partner?
Please dance with me.
Um, I'm fine.
Hmm...{LF}I humbly accept your invitation.
That's an interesting proposition but{LF}I'm afraid I'm going to{LF}have to turn it down.
I hope you find a good partner.
Where'd you learn to dance like{LF}that, ＠カイル＠＠? You must have{LF}had some training.
I'm really sorry for embarrassing{LF}you earlier.
Hmm? ＠カイル＠＠, where exactly{LF}were you leading me today?
It's the Dance Festival.{LF}How about you try and inviting{LF}someone special to you, ＠アルス＠＠?
Congratulations on winning.
I guess if I'm ever in the mood for{LF}fresh fish, all I need to do is ask you.
I heard Dorothy won the{LF}competition today.
Maybe she has some sort of{LF}special sense when it to fishing.
Congratulations on winning a{LF}honorable mention, ＠カイル＠＠.
All that really matters is that{LF}you enjoyed yourself.
Fishing is a fierce, heroic battle.
A match between person and fish. A{LF}gladiatorial contest where your wits{LF}will earn you glorious victory or{LF}crushing defeat.
...Juuuuust kidding!|{LF}I was just quoting my brother.{LF}Fishing is relaxing, isn't it?
Today's the Big Cook-Off.{LF}Your grandfather trains for this all{LF}year. It always gets him very{LF}excited.
Today's the Big Cook-Off.{LF}My dad is always so excited about{LF}today, given that he spends the{LF}the entire year training for it.
I bet you're going to be{LF}talented when it comes to{LF}cooking too, ＠アルス＠＠!|
Cooking is mostly effort and{LF}creativity. Work hard so{LF}you can win next year!
Congratulations on winning{LF}the Adventure Contest.{LF}I don't think I can say anything{LF}except that I'm impressed.
Congratulations on winning{LF}a honorable mention!
I hereby confer upon you the{LF}title of Amateur Adventurer!|
I think the Adventure Contest {LF}is really just entertainment.{LF}Regardless of whether you win or lose,{LF}it's fun enough to participate.
I think the Adventure Contest {LF}is really just entertainment.{LF}Regardless of whether you win or lose,{LF}it's fun enough to participate.
Then again, sometimes it can be fun{LF}to really try and win.
Congratulations on winning!{LF}Good job!
Congratulations on{LF}winning honorable mention!{LF}Good job!
The participation prize, huh?{LF}That must be disappointing.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}It looks like kids can participate{LF}too, but... 
Today's the day that we give thanks{LF}for all the food that we can harvest.
Today's the Harvest Festival.{LF}How're your crops coming along{LF}＠アルス＠＠? I bet they're doing well.
Sweetheart, please go and give{LF}the people around town some of{LF}the food you've been harvesting.{LF}I'm sure they'll be very happy.
How wonderful!
Looks like the strong follow{LF}the stronger.
Congratulations on{LF}winning honorable mention.
I guess that proves that{LF}your monster is pretty{LF}strong.
Your monster must be one of{LF}those friendly ones that don't{LF}like violence.
 ＠カイル＠＠, if you've been raising{LF}a monster that you're really proud{LF}of,
how about you try entering the{LF}competition and taking the top prize?
Hmm... {LF}It looks like you can tame{LF}monsters just like your dad, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Hmm... {LF}It looks like you can tame{LF}monsters just like your dad, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Hmm... {LF}It looks like you can tame{LF}monsters just like your dad, {LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Is it the Monster Contest{LF}today? I'm not going to stop{LF}you from participating, but{LF}try not to overdo it, okay?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.
Shooting stars, shooting stars...{LF}Don't you think the words just{LF}sound so romantic?
Would you like to go see {LF}them together?
Um... they're nice.
Hmm... well I can't think of{LF}any reason to say no.
Let's go together!|
Okay, I'll be waiting at{LF}＠マップ９＠ {LF}at 9:00 tonight.
I'm sorry, but I can't accept{LF}your proposal just yet...
But you can have lots of{LF}fun looking at them by yourself.
I hope I'll be able to see{LF}lots of stars in the sky tonight.
Um, I'm really sorry that{LF}I had to turn you down earlier.
It's a little embarrassing but{LF}this was actually the first time I've{LF}ever seen real shooting stars.
They really took my breath away.
＠カイル＠＠... 
Maybe you've already got a date?
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.
This is a very important day{LF}to me... It's full of very{LF}special memories... 
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Are you interested in the stars at{LF}all, ＠アルス＠＠?
Congratulations on winning!{LF}You're a lot stronger than{LF}you look, ＠カイル＠＠.
There's a lot of luck involved in{LF}mining, and it looks like{LF}lady luck was on someone{LF}else's side this time...
Even though you wanted to{LF}win, you just couldn't get{LF}it together...
Well, these things happen.
Will you be participating in{LF}the Mining Contest, ＠カイル＠＠?
Today's the Mining Contest.
You've really grown up, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}but to be honest, I still have some{LF}reservations about letting you{LF}go out to fight monsters...
I think he's old enough.{LF}He'll be fine.
Well... it might be a little dangerous but{LF}I'm not going to try and stop him{LF}from entering anymore.
I respect your opinion, sweetheart.
I hear that Orland and Leonel{LF}will be competing in the Mining{LF}Contest too.
Congratulations!{LF}You're really something, ＠アルス＠＠!
What a shame.{LF}Oh well, take this loss for what{LF}it is and work hard to do better.
There are only a couple{LF}of hours left in the year.
Best wishes for the coming{LF}year, ＠カイル＠＠.
The year wraps up today.
Good things, bad things{LF}happy things, sad things...{LF}lots of things happened this year.
But all of these things help{LF}make you who you are, sweetheart, {LF}and help make ＠アルス＠＠ such{LF}a special person.
So many things await you{LF}in the new year too, sweetheart.
Take all of them for what they{LF}are and use them to help you{LF}find yourself.
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠, is{LF}there something I can help{LF}you with?
I saw the bulletin board. It{LF}sounds like you're having a {LF}hard time. If you want, maybe {LF}I could help you out.
Ahh, really?{LF}You're a lifesaver.
Okay, let me tell you about what I{LF}need. You know of Trieste Forest,{LF}right?
It's the dungeon to the{LF}east of ＠マップ８＠.
Well, if you go into {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and walk forward a little bit, the road{LF}splits off in two directions.
There, if you face north,
you should take the path{LF}on your right.
Once you do that, you should{LF}be able to find a flower called{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠ right under{LF}your feet.
Please pick that flower and{LF}then bring it back here.
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G as a{LF}reward if you get the job done.
Okay, thank you so much.
If you go into the {LF}＠マップ９＠,{LF}you should see a fork in the{LF}path.
Head to your right and you'll find{LF}the ＠アイテム９＠. Please pick it{LF}and bring it back here for me.
Trieste Forest is full of monsters,{LF}so it can get really dangerous.
I know it's kind of a big favor,{LF}but you'd really be helping me out.
Thank you so much.{LF}You're a lifesaver.
Good day, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You came to ask me about{LF}the message on the board, right?
Sorry for this being on such short{LF}notice, but let me explain what{LF}I'd like you to do.
I want you to get your hands on{LF}a type of fruit called an ＠アイテム９＠.
Please bring one to me.
 ＠アイテム９＠s  grow on apple{LF}trees, so all you need to do{LF}is pick one, right?
My problem is where{LF}the apple tree is growing...
Where exactly is it growing?
In...Trieste Forest 
The apple tree is in{LF}＠マップ９＠,{LF}which has become a monster's den.
I see...
It might be a bit dangerous, but...
If you do this for me, I'll give{LF}you ＠数字９＠G as a reward.
So thank you in advance.
＠アイテム９＠s  grow on the{LF}apple tree in {LF}＠マップ９＠.
It might be a little dangerous, but{LF}please try and do me this favor.
Thank you so much, {LF}you're a lifesaver.{LF}I'll be sure to ask you some{LF}other favors in the future.
Hm? Looks like you don't have{LF}any space in your backpack,{LF}＠カイル＠＠...
Try talking to me again after you've{LF}freed up at least one item slot.
Ah, it looks like your backpack{LF}is fine now.
So, please accept this  ＠アイテム８＠
You acquired a  ＠アイテム８＠ 
This ＠アイテム８＠ is a necessary{LF}vital piece of equipment if you want{LF}to collect anything from the monsters{LF}that you're raising.
For example...
You can collect Honey from a{LF}Hornet or a Queen Bee, 
and Eggs from a Cluckadoodle. 
When you want to use it,{LF}press the L Button and the{LF}B Button to bring up the{LF}Quick Equip: Tool menu.
Select the ＠アイテム８＠ from{LF}the Quick Equip: Tool menu and{LF}press the B Button again.
If you do that, the  ＠アイテム８＠{LF}will be equipped in your right hand{LF}item slot.
With it equipped, if you go up to one of{LF}your Hornets or Queen Bees 
And press the B Button, you'll be{LF}able to collect Honey from them.
You can do the same thing to{LF}collect Eggs from a Cluckadoodle. 
That's the end of the explanation.
If you use the ＠アイテム８＠ you'll{LF}be able to collect  Eggs  and  Honey {LF}on a regular basis
from the monsters that you{LF}befriend in the forests and the{LF}caves.
From a culinary or an economic{LF}standpoint, it should help you{LF}out quite a bit, ＠カイル＠＠.
Please, use it wisely!
It looks like your backpack{LF}empty enough.
With that, please accept{LF}this  ＠アイテム９＠. 
It looks like your backpack is all{LF}full again. Try talking to me after{LF}you've put your items in order.
Welcome, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}So you saw the bulletin board?
You're a lifesaver.
This is kind of embarrassing, {LF}so I ask that you please don't{LF}tell anyone else.
Understood.
Can you get a little bit{LF}closer to me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Huh? L-L-Like this?
Like that.
I'm going to speak quietly,{LF}so listen carefully...
Okay...
Are you alright?
Y-Yup.{LF}(Her breath is really tickling my{LF}ear...)
Head to the mayor's house and{LF}make sure that nobody sees you.
I want you to give Byron{LF}this secret message for me.
No matter what happens,{LF}remember to be discreet.
I'm not sure, but Barrett{LF}might be there too.
This goes without saying, but make{LF}sure he doesn't notice you either.
I've prepared a reward{LF}of ＠数字９＠G for you{LF}if you do this for me.
On that note, here's{LF}the  ＠アイテム９＠. 
Hey! It looks like your{LF}backpack is totally{LF}full, ＠カイル＠＠.
Try talking to me again after{LF}you've put your things in{LF}order.
If you've got more than one{LF}of the same thing in your bag,{LF}you can stack them and free{LF}up an item slot.
You can also put weapons and{LF}shields that you don't use on{LF}the Shelf in your house and seeds{LF}and food and stuff in the Refrigerator. 
You can also just throw away{LF}items that you don't need.
So, do whatever's best for{LF}you to free up some space{LF}in your backpack.
Received: ＠アイテム９＠.
Make sure nobody sees you{LF}while you're delivering the{LF} ＠アイテム９＠. 
Good work, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It looks like everything went fine.
Yes. Byron said he understood. 
Hmmm...that's a relief.{LF}Thank you so much, ＠カイル＠＠.
Well done. Please{LF}accept your reward.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
I'm also going to give you 100 pieces{LF}of wood on top of that.
You got 100 pieces of wood.
Ah! And...
I know I've said this already,{LF}but please make sure not to tell{LF}anybody about this.
I know I've said this already,{LF}but please make sure not to tell{LF}anybody about this.
You look in good spirits, ＠カイル＠＠.
This might be an odd question,{LF}but do you have a hard time taking{LF}medicine?
Medicine? Um, no, I'm fine{LF}with it for the most part.
Excellent!
Okay, here's what {LF}I need you to do...
I developed this medicine and{LF}I want to give you a dose so I{LF}can see how effective it is.
Huh?! You mean you want me to{LF}be...a test subject?
That's what you mean{LF}by "Research Assistant"?
Yep! So, are you ready to help advance{LF}our scientific knowledge?
Uhhhh...
I see... What a shame.{LF}I guess I'll just have to give up.
Ahh... If I could only test this{LF}medicine and get some confirmation{LF}of its effects...
It would be such a big help to{LF}all those people that are {LF}struggling with colds...
!!!
...............
Okay, I'll do it!{LF}I'll test it out for you, Rosalind,{LF}and you can see if it works.
R-R-Really?!{LF}Thank you so much!
Well, to test this cold medicine, the{LF}test subject must have what is{LF}commonly known as a "cold."{LF}In other words, I need you to get sick!
So, first things first,{LF}please go catch a cold!
I've prepared ＠数字９＠G{LF}as a reward this time.
Okay, thanks in advance.
Huh? It looks like you haven't{LF}caught a cold yet.
If it feels like no matter how hard{LF}you try you just can't catch a cold,{LF}how about you try staying up for{LF}two nights and see what happens?
Wow, you look pretty sick, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How wonderful! Now we can{LF}start the experiment!
First I'm going to take your{LF}temperature. I'm going to{LF}touch your forehead, okay?
Um...okay.
(Whoa! Rosalind's hands{LF}feel so nice and cool.)
Hm. It looks like you've{LF}got a bit of a temperature.
And you're shivering a bit...{LF}Like a scared little animal...
Plus your nose is all red.
I would say that you have{LF}successfully caught a cold!
It's quite a good one, too...{LF}I really have to give you credit for{LF}this, ＠カイル＠＠. You've gone above{LF}and beyond the call of duty!
Now, in the name of science...{LF}bottoms up!
The cold is gone!
Wow!!!{LF}I can't believe how quickly that{LF}worked. I feel totally fine!
I did it!{LF}You look like you're feeling{LF}100% better, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll bet this new medicine{LF}will be a hit for sure!
Thank you so much.{LF}I would have never been able to{LF}do this without your cooperation.
Really, the world of medical science{LF}is in your debt.{LF}Please, take this. You deserve it.
You acquired ＠数字９＠G
Also, ＠カイル＠＠?
What is it?
I was wondering if maybe you{LF}could come by to see{LF}me on a regular basis?
I can't really say it's ready until{LF}I study it for long-term side effects...
Huh?!{LF}S-Side effects???
Oh, don't be silly.{LF}I'm reasonably certain that there's{LF}nothing to worry about.
You'll probably...{LF}most likely...{LF}no, you'll definitely be okay.
.............
It was thanks to your help,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, that I was able to finish{LF}making this medicine.{LF}Thank you so much!|
You look in good spirits, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I've been waiting for you.
I've been thinking that I'd like to{LF}share all of the new recipes that{LF}I've been creating with someone.
Okay.
(It looks like I'm the only {LF}person she has to share them with.)
So... {LF}On that note... 
If it's okay with you... {LF}To repay all the favors{LF}that you've done me... 
I would be honored if you{LF}allowed me to cook for you.{LF}I'll prepare every recipe I've{LF}invented!
F-F-For me?
Of course.{LF}If this doesn't appeal to you,{LF}you can say no... 
..................
But still... 
If you can, I‘d really like{LF}for you to taste my food, ＠カイル＠＠...
Oh, what am I saying?{LF}It's not like me to be so...so pushy.
Rosalind!
It's not very often that I have{LF}the chance to sample your food.
How could I pass up an opportunity{LF}like this?
I'll absolutely let you cook for me!
R-Really?!
Yaaaay! Thaaaaank you.
How about we have the meal at{LF}＠マップ９＠?{LF}Everything tastes better when{LF}you eat it outside, doesn't it?
Outside? That sounds great.
Okay, I'll start making preparations.
Why don't you head to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}a little bit ahead of me, okay?
My food-loving father gave this{LF}food his seal of approval. So you{LF}better be thrilled!
Why don't you head to{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}a little bit ahead of me, okay?
I'll hurry over as soon as I'm{LF}done preparing everything.
 ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Come over here.
I made us a picnic.{LF}Please, eat up.
This looks delicious!{LF}Let's get started!
*munch munch munch*
How does it taste?
This taste of this is... exquisite.
And it smells wonderful.
It really wraps around your{LF}tongue... but it's subtle, too.
This is really an amazing dish!
Sounds like you like it.{LF}That's good...
All the testing I did with{LF}my father was worth it.
Yummy, yummy.{LF}*munch munch munch*
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠, you've got{LF}some rice on your cheek. Here,{LF}I'll get it for you...
...............{LF}!!!
Okay, I got it.{LF}Calm down, please. Savor the food.
*munch munch*{LF}*gulp gulp*{LF}*munch munch*
Whew, I'm full.{LF}That was quite a feast.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.{LF}I hope I'll get another opportunity{LF}to cook for you some time!
Heh, I can't wait!{LF}Thank you!
Ah, look at the time.{LF}I've got to get home.
It was very nice spending{LF}time together today.
Thank you for helping me{LF}make such a nice memory.
Thank you for the feast.{LF}Tomorrow I'll be back to{LF}working for you again.
Heeheehee!|
You look to be in bright spirits{LF}today, ＠カイル＠＠.
You've come about the{LF}bulletin board, right?
Yup. I was thinking that I'd{LF}like to help you out.
Heeheehee!|{LF}Everything's going exactly to plan.
Huh?!
Well, who else would accept such{LF}dangerous work, ＠カイル＠＠?
Uh...dangerous?
Hey, don't look so nervous.{LF}You'll be fine. I've never met anyone{LF}who can handle monsters as well as{LF}you can.
Anyhow, the monster I want you{LF}to catch for me is called the{LF}＠モンスター９＠ and it lives in{LF}＠マップ９＠. 
You can collect ＠アイテム９＠{LF}from it.
And I need that ＠アイテム９＠{LF}no matter what.
So I want you to go and{LF}catch one for me, okay?
Understood. I'll get it done.
Thank you.
Once you've caught it, collect the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ from it and then{LF}bring it to me, please.
Got it.
I've prepared a reward of{LF}＠数字９＠G for you.
Okay, see you soon.
Oh, one more thing!{LF}The  ＠モンスター９＠ only{LF}comes out at night.
Got it! In that case, I'll{LF}head out to catch it after{LF}sunset.
Once you've caught a Woolly, collect{LF}the ＠アイテム９＠ from it and then{LF}bring it to me please.
I'll be praying for your{LF}safety and success.
Thank you so much.{LF}You're a lifesaver.
You're looking well today, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, Rosalind. I've come about{LF}your message on the board.
Thank you for accepting{LF}my request. You'll really be{LF}a big help.
You need to test some{LF}new magic, right?
Yes.
Okay, so let's get started.{LF}About this new spell...
It will cause a localized explosion{LF}on a designated target.{LF}It's pretty dangerous.
The size of the explosion is only{LF}a couple of square yards, but{LF}everything within it will be subjected{LF}to incredibly high heat and pressure.
(That's a pretty scary spell.)
Okay, so anyways, the point{LF}is, ＠カイル＠＠...
I was hoping that you would do me a{LF}favor and come with me to see whether{LF}or not the spell works properly.
I-Is this going to be safe?
Of course it'll be safe! There's{LF}no reason to worry.
If my calculations are correct,{LF}there's no reason for anything{LF}to go wrong.
But I can't prove my theories{LF}if I don't conduct experiments!
This seems like kind of a{LF}dangerous experiment, but...
If you're sure it's safe, I'll trust{LF}you. Count me in!
Thank you!
I'll be conducting the experiment{LF}at ＠マップ９＠. 
I'll head to the testing site early{LF}and make all the necessary preparations.
Understood. I'll head over{LF}there as soon as I can.
I'm going to go to {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}early and set everything up.
I was waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Still, I was a little worried that you{LF}wouldn't show up.
I'm quite flattered. You must have a{LF}lot of faith in my abilities!
No no, it's really nothing. So, let's{LF}get this experiment started. On the{LF}off chance that anything goes wrong,{LF}I'll be here to protect you.
Umm...about the spell... I{LF}kind of made it all up.
I really just wanted to know how you{LF}felt about me and my abilities, so{LF}I just figured I'd...
What?
..................
You're mad, aren't you?{LF}That makes sense. I'm sorry if you're{LF}angry that I tested you.
Still...you didn't worry about the{LF}danger, and you accepted such a{LF}ridiculous request so bravely... {LF}It made me really happy.
Rosalind, I'm not mad at you at all.
Honestly, I'm mostly relieved to know{LF}that you made the whole thing up.{LF}That spell sounded awfully scary!
Well...do you forgive me?
I forgive you... {LF}You told a lie because you wanted{LF}to see how I felt about you.
Honestly...that makes me really happy.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}I'm so happy right now.
Heh. Well, I'll see you later,{LF}Rosalind.
See you later, ＠カイル＠＠!|
You're looking very cheery{LF}today, ＠カイル＠＠.
You saw my message, right?
Do you know anything {LF}about the ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}It's very rare.
If you have one, might you please{LF}consider giving it to me?
Even if you don't have one right now,{LF}perhaps you might be able to get{LF}one somewhere?
I've prepared ＠数字９＠G{LF}for you as a token of my{LF}appreciation...
Got it. If it'll help you out, I'll{LF}see if I can find some way to{LF}get one for you.
Getting your hands on a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}will probably be really difficult, but{LF}you'll be doing me a huge favor.
But still, you could call this a{LF}nearly impossible task.
Maybe, just maybe, my brother{LF}might have some information on{LF}the ＠アイテム９＠.
It might be a good idea for you{LF}to try talking to him when he's{LF}in his room...
You're looking well, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I've been waiting for you.
So what's up?
The truth is, there's been some talk{LF}about me getting engaged... 
W-What?!
Well, the suitor is the son of{LF}the head of a trading firm{LF}that does business with my{LF}father's company.
According to my father, he comes{LF}from a good family, he's financially{LF}secure, and he's very handsome.
............
But there's already somebody{LF}else that I've got my heart set on...
So I turned him down...
Then my father asked who it{LF}was that I did want to marry{LF}and I... Well, I... 
I told him that I was in love{LF}with you, ＠カイル＠＠!
!!!
When I told him that, first{LF}he was surprised, and then he{LF}started considering it...{LF}
Then he broke the{LF}silence and said...
"Ahh-haa, so you only have eyes{LF}for ＠カイル＠＠..."
"I seeeeee..."
"Soooo, I've always wanted to try{LF}＠アイテム９＠."
"If that ＠カイル＠＠ can get{LF}his hands on it for me..."
"Then I'll know he's the right man{LF}for you!"
Well, you get the idea.
............
Did you know that I{LF}love you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Moreover, if you love me too...
Could you do this for me?{LF}Even though it's difficult?
Rosalind!
Y-Yes?
I have my heart set{LF}on you, too!
!!!!!!!!!!
I will overcome any obstacle that{LF}stands in the way of our love.
My abilities as a farmer, as a miner,{LF}as a fisherman, as a lumberjack...{LF}And everything else... I promise{LF}to use all of them for you.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}From the bottom of my heart.{LF}
I know now that my love for{LF}you is not unrequited.
And I will never stray.
Okay! If we clear this hurdle, we{LF}can start a new chapter of our{LF}lives, together!
So, about the ＠アイテム９＠...
It's a dish first made by {LF}a world-class chef using {LF}the finest ingredients.
No matter what happens, you{LF}have to get your hands on one!
I know!
After you've gotten one, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}first come and give it to me.
Then we'll approach my father together.
No matter what happens, please{LF}find a ＠アイテム９＠ for my father.
However, getting one is not{LF}going to be easy... Do you have{LF}any ideas?
Hmm... Actually, maybe my brother{LF}could tell us something.
It might be a good idea to try{LF}talking to him when he's in his{LF}room...
You look very handsome{LF}today, ＠カイル＠＠.
We're finally going out with{LF}my father's approval...
How about we get all dressed{LF}up and go on a date? Officially!
I know a place where we{LF}won't be bothered by anybody.
Where nobody will bother us?{LF}If that's true, it sounds like the{LF}ideal spot for a date. So, where{LF}is it?
At ＠マップ９＠. 
＠マップ９＠, huh?{LF}That's definitely off the beaten path...
There might be some dangerous{LF}monsters there, but if you're with{LF}me, I've got nothing to worry about!
Right?
Uh, of course.{LF}I won't let them lay a finger on you.
How wonderful!{LF}It looks like you're getting{LF}crazier for me by the day.
Ahahaha!
Okay, I'll be waiting for{LF}you at ＠マップ９＠. 
I'll be waiting for{LF}you at {LF}＠マップ９＠. 
I was waiting for you, ＠カイル＠＠.
This place might be a little dangerous,{LF}but that will let us be sure that nobody{LF}will intrude... It'll be just the{LF}two of us...
Yeah, definitely... Nobody's{LF}going to show up here.
...............
...............
(R-R-Rosalind's touching the{LF}back of my hand...)
Your hands are bigger than I{LF}thought they'd be, ＠カイル＠＠...
And they're so warm...
They're just like the calm breeze that{LF}blows through Trieste Forest.
Rosalind... I'll never let you go.
.........{LF}.........
＠カイル＠＠... The very first time I{LF}laid eyes on you, I felt a connection{LF}that I couldn't understand... 
But I think it might have been{LF}inevitable that the two of us{LF}would wind up here like this.
Look out at the horizon.
The horizon...{LF}The sunlight looks so beautiful{LF}reflected off the water.
It does. Also...
The endless flow of the waves.
It feels like the eternal{LF}happiness that awaits us.
You're right.{LF}I hope this happiness goes on forever.
Heeheehee!|
Ahh, would you look at the time!{LF}Let's start heading back.
Today was absolutely wonderful.
It was very moving.{LF}Thank you.
Okay, I guess we should get going{LF}now. (Things are getting pretty{LF}serious with Rosalind. I should talk{LF}to Max about this in his room.)
＠カイル＠＠, the memory of{LF}that date with you... {LF}I'll never forget it.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠. I suppose{LF}you saw the bulletin board?
Yup. What can I do for you?
Yup. How can I help you?
Ah, thank you.
Sorry for the short notice, but{LF}could you catch a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}for me?
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G.{LF}I hope that's all right.{LF}Thanks so much for your help.
Please catch a ＠アイテム９＠ for{LF}me, ＠アルス＠＠.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠. You saw the{LF}bulletin board, I assume?
Yup! What can I do for you?
Yup! What can I do for you?
First of all, thanks for your{LF}help.
Anyway, sorry for the short{LF}notice, but could you get some{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me?
I'll give you ＠数字９＠G for your{LF}trouble. I hope that's all right.{LF}Thank you so much.
Please get me some ＠アイテム９＠,{LF}＠アルス＠＠. Thank you.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠. You're a{LF}lifesaver.
Ah, this is the  ＠アイテム９＠{LF}I asked Mana for.
And who might you be?
Nice to meet you.{LF}My name's ＠カイル＠＠.
My name is Rosalind de{LF}Sainte-Coquille.
My father and my brother might be a{LF}bit of a nuisance for you sometimes,{LF}but I hope that we'll be able to get along.
Ah, me too.
My father and my brother are good{LF}people, they're just easily misunderstood.{LF}Please do your best to bear with them.
Will do.
So, please give me the ＠アイテム９＠ now.
Press the L Button and the A Button{LF}to open the Quick Select: Item menu.{LF}Then press the A Button while facing{LF}me to give me the item.
Okay.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠. Did you bring me the{LF}＠アイテム９＠ I asked Mana for?
Yep!
Wonderful! Now you can give{LF}it to me.
Press the L Button and the A Button{LF}to open the Quick Select: Item menu.{LF}Then press the A Button while facing{LF}me to give me the item.
Do you understand?
Okay, I got it. Now just go{LF}and talk to Mana and the{LF}quest will be complete.
You really liked my Golden Cabbage{LF}Salad that much? I'm so glad!
Rosalind, I'm patrolling the town{LF}to make sure that there's nothing{LF}out of the ordinary going on. {LF}Have you noticed anything strange?
Anything strange? Nothing in particular.{LF}Thanks for working so hard, ＠カイル＠＠.
The spring sun feels so nice.{LF}If you stood under it for too long, you'd{LF}probably fall asleep right {LF}where you were.
I want to get a good view so I can{LF}really take in the cherry blossoms {LF}tomorrow.
That was quite the earthquake.{LF}I just hope that it isn't a sign{LF}that something bad is coming...
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest.{LF}It's a big festival about food.
My father's getting so excited...{LF}I bet he's having trouble sleeping.
Swimming season starts tomorrow.
It's finally time to unveil the{LF}new white bikini that I've been{LF}getting ready!
Tomorrow's the Monster{LF}Taming Contest.{LF}Will you be participating, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, take care that you don't do{LF}anything careless and get hurt.
That earthquake didn't bother me{LF}too much, but the walls in my house{LF}are all cracked.
A man in the prime of his life like you
should make sure to eat a lot of{LF}foods that boost his stamina.
The Dance Festival is tomorrow.
I hope I can find a nice partner to{LF}enjoy some very elegant dancing with.
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest.
When I hear about fishing, all I{LF}can think of is eating some{LF}fresh-caught trout!
Tomorrow's the Adventure Contest.{LF}Will you be participating, ＠カイル＠＠?
That was some earthquake.{LF}I thought my whole house was going{LF}to collapse.
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival.
I know that I'm thankful for crops,{LF}the farmers who grow them, and{LF}the land which makes it all possible.
Of course, that means I'm very{LF}grateful to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
Fall... It's the season for food. {LF}And whenever I hear food, {LF}I think of my father's appetite.
What on earth will I do if he eats{LF}too much and gets some {LF}strange illness...
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest.
Maybe I'll try to participate too.{LF}Heehee.
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival.
You could say that it is a day{LF}that was designed for lovers...
It's gotten really cold. {LF}Every morning when I{LF}wake up, my garden {LF}is covered with frost.
How about I get you a brand-new{LF}hammer for the Mining Contest?
Hmm... I guess that{LF}might be overdoing it.
From a statistical standpoint, the{LF}amount of earthquakes that we've{LF}been experiencing lately is {LF}quite bizarre...
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve...{LF}I think that just once I'd like to{LF}try spending it with people other{LF}than my family...
Be sure to grow lots of delicious{LF}spring vegetables, ＠アルス＠＠.
Summer makes me think of getting{LF}a tan. But I got to be careful not to{LF}tan too much!
If you do, I hear your skin will{LF}get blotchy when you get older.
Make sure to eat lots of{LF}nutritious fall vegetables!
It's really hard to grow anything{LF}in the winter, but do your best!
Each season in Alvarna shows a{LF}different side of Mother Nature.
It's really quite amazing.
I don't know why, but I find{LF}myself fascinated by things{LF}like that.
Do you know much about the{LF}layout of Alvarna, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I can explain it to you, if you'd like.
I'll pass.
Please do.
I see...
The center of Alvarna is{LF}＠マップ５＠, {LF}but the real heart of the town lies{LF}east and west of there.
In  ＠マップ６＠ you'll find Alvarna{LF}Clinic, the Pumpkin General Store,{LF}the Wisdom Bathhouse, and{LF}the Sharper Edge Blacksmith.
You can also get to your{LF}home from there.
In ＠マップ７＠ you'll find the{LF}de Sainte-Coquille estate, which{LF}is my house, the Eagle Inn, Alvarna{LF}Church, and the mayor's house.
From there, you can leave the{LF}town through {LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}and ＠マップ８＠. {LF}
Also, you'll find the harbor south{LF}of the park. We call that place{LF}＠マップ４＠. It's{LF}our connection to the outside world.
And with that, our verbal tour{LF}comes to an end.
Was it helpful?
Alvarna nights are so calm, aren't they?{LF}You can't hear a peep.
Honestly, this is my ideal atmosphere.
Do you eat breakfast every{LF}morning, ＠カイル＠＠?
I'm not much of a morning person... {LF}so I usually just have a croissant.
So something happened at{LF}lunch yesterday...
My brother brought out some{LF}weird exotic utensils... He called{LF}them "chopsticks"... 
and he tried really hard to use{LF}these chopsticks to eat a salad...
and he just looked so funny that{LF}I just couldn't help myself {LF}and started laughing
But I think that if someone were{LF}to master using these chopsticks, {LF}they might actually be even more{LF}useful than a fork and knife.
Last night me and my father {LF}had dinner just the two of us. {LF}Without my brother.{LF}
My family has an unwritten rule{LF}that we always eat dinner together,
So my father was in a terrible{LF}mood throughout the entire meal.
Even I couldn't enjoy it.{LF}Dinner's supposed to be a {LF}happy time with my family.
I really like ＠アイテム９＠.
Legend has it that this white clover{LF}brings good luck to whoever has it.
Teeheehee, I must sound{LF}pretty superstitious.
Sometimes I have quite the appetite...{LF}I guess I am my father's daughter.
Sometime when that happens,{LF}I think about something{LF}mild like a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to try and distract myself... 
But it backfires!{LF}I just grow hungrier.
*gulp*
＠アイテム９＠ has to be{LF}my favorite aperitif.
 ＠アイテム９＠ is full of things{LF}that you need to stay healthy.
It's delicious AND healthy, so it's like{LF}killing two birds with one stone.
Well... That's really just an excuse.
If I had to pick a favorite food,{LF}it would be  ＠アイテム９＠. 
＠カイル＠＠, do you know{LF}Julia and Dorothy?
It's almost strange how well{LF}I get along with those two...
We're three different people{LF}with three very distinct identities, {LF}but...
The truth it seems like there must{LF}be something special between the{LF}three of us that we're not aware of.
For example...{LF}I've heard people teasing Julia{LF}as a "fashion disaster" and such...
But that's so far off the mark.{LF}I can't stand it.
What do you mean?
Well, clothing is a type of {LF}self-expression, is it not? {LF}Couldn't her style be seen{LF}as a form of art?
Hmm......
Well, at any rate, I do know{LF}that you two are very close.
And I can say with confidence that{LF}I'm Dorothy's closest friend.
But there's one thing about{LF}her that even I don't know.
What is it?
The name of that doll that{LF}she carries around with her.
Her doll's...name?
Huh...{LF}Well, I'm not going to try and{LF}force it out of her, so don't worry.
...............
Norad generally stays out of conflicts{LF}between the major world powers, so{LF}we've managed to avoid the tragedy{LF}of war for a long time now.
Norad's known as a country that{LF}works hard for the wealth and {LF}welfare of its citizens.
Norad is also said to be the{LF}birthplace of humanity.
This is all common knowledge, so{LF}you should try and remember it.
There's no war in Norad, but we{LF}can't assume that we're completely{LF}immune to the rest of the world.
What are those foreign ships that{LF}pass through our harbor carrying?{LF}And what on earth will they use{LF}that stuff for?
............
Of all the books I've read{LF}recently, the most interesting was{LF}probably this mystery novel called{LF}"Birds of a Feather"...
The author lives in the Sechs Empire.
It's so interesting that someone{LF}capable of creating such an amazing{LF}work of art could live
in such an unproductive country.
Something happened earlier...
I saw my brother's "chopsticks" rolling{LF}around and I just started laughing...
I wonder what came over me...
Something happened earlier...
I saw my brother's "chopsticks" rolling{LF}around and I just started laughing...
I wonder what came over me...
No, no, no, that's just funny.
It was a totally normal response.
I got into the habit of having a{LF}piece of ＠アイテム９＠ after breakfast.
It's a very nutritious fruit.{LF}Plus it's delicious.
I got into the habit of having a{LF}piece of ＠アイテム９＠ after lunch.
It's a very nutritious fruit.{LF}Plus it's delicious.
I got into the habit of having a{LF}piece of ＠アイテム９＠ after dinner.
It's a very nutritious fruit.{LF}Plus it's delicious.
I heard the latest news about{LF}fashions in Norad from this designer{LF}I know.
According to this...
This year's Norad Fashion Show{LF}showcased several new designers{LF}that are worth keeping an eye on.
Uh huh, hmmmmm...{LF}I don't really get it.
Huh? Do you not have an{LF}interest in fashion, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not really.{LF}I'm kind of out of the loop.
I see.
But I think you should try and keep{LF}up with at least some fashion basics.
Hmmm... 
I got the latest news on the state{LF}of fashion in Norad from this designer{LF}I know.
According to this... 
Most of the major designers have{LF}been touting a layered look that{LF}combines a lot of different styles...
It has a kind of elegance no matter{LF}what you choose to wear...{LF}Isn't it wonderful?
Um, it's very nice.{LF}(I don't really know anything{LF}about fashion but...)
I got the latest news on the state{LF}of fashion in Norad from this designer{LF}I know.
According to this... 
The garish styles that were such a{LF}hit last season aren't so popular{LF}this year, but... 
They're still finding a very strong{LF}audience in young girls.
Skirts are getting shorter and{LF}bright colors like red and{LF}orange are becoming more popular.
Hehehe.
I got it! Why don't you try wearing{LF}one of those skirts, Rosalind? I think{LF}it would suit you.
No, I'm SURE it would suit you.
Hmm...{LF}If you say so, ＠カイル＠＠.
Have you heard the rumor about the{LF}turnip that resembles a young girl's {LF}face?
Apparently, if you sprinkle some water{LF}that's been exposed to the light of the{LF}crescent moon on arid land at exactly{LF}2:02:02 PM, it might grow.
Have you heard the rumor about{LF}the flower that resembles a face?
Apparently, if you sprinkle some water{LF}that's been exposed to the light of the{LF}full moon on arid land at exactly{LF}4:04:04 PM, it might bloom.
Have you heard the rumor about the{LF}peach that looks like a cat's paw?
Apparently, if you sprinkle some water{LF}that's been exposed to the light of the{LF}new moon on arid land at exactly{LF}midnight, it might grow.
Have you ever heard the saying{LF}"politeness is not just for strangers"? 
Well, if you don't know somebody,{LF}it's hard to know what's rude {LF}to them, right?
So I figure I'll tell you in advance...
I'd hate being given a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ as a present{LF}more than anything.
Try not to forget that.
There's an old proverb that says{LF}"politeness is not just for{LF}strangers"... 
But it's hard to be polite to someone{LF}if you don't know anything about them.
So I figure I'll tell you in advance...
I'd hate being given a {LF}＠アイテム９＠ as a present{LF}more than anything.
Try not to forget that.
There's an old proverb that says{LF}"politeness is not just for{LF}strangers"...

Hmm?
The 27th of autumn.
Do...you know what makes{LF}that day so special?
It's my birthday!
Hm? {LF}Ahh, I see...

Sorry to ask you this out of{LF}the blue, but what do you{LF}think of me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Hmm, well, the thing about that is... 
Eh, nothing in particular.
You're not very decisive.
Hmm...{LF}Well, I don't have any ulterior{LF}motives in asking this question,{LF}so just be honest.
Sorry to ask you this out of{LF}the blue, but what do you{LF}think of me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Umm, well, ah...
Eh, nothing in particular.
You're not very decisive.
I see...{LF}Well, I don't have any ulterior{LF}motives in asking this question,{LF}so just be honest.
Sorry to ask you this out of{LF}the blue, but what do you{LF}think of me, ＠カイル＠＠?
Hmm, well, the thing about that is... 
Eh, nothing in particular.
I like you.
You're not very decisive.
I see...{LF}Well, I don't have any ulterior{LF}motives in asking this question,{LF}so just be honest.
Well... That was very straightforward.{LF}I feel like I'm going to blush.
You've been working hard in the{LF}fields all day, haven't you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
How wonderful. You're glistening{LF}with the sweat from the hard work...  
Looks like you're going to be{LF}able to harvest some very{LF}nutritious food.
This is a silly question, but{LF}do you enjoy farming?
It's great.
It's okay, I guess.
I see. If you like farming,
you might possess some of the{LF}qualities of an Earthmate...
Hmm... {LF}You're not very ambitious, are you?
Well, there aren't many people that{LF}can totally lose themselves in {LF}farming...
This is kind of embarrassing {LF}but if I don't drink a glass of {LF}warm milk before I go to bed...
...I have a hard time falling asleep.
Can't fall asleep without drinking{LF}a glass of warm milk... Doesn't it{LF}sound so childish? It's a habit I'm{LF}trying to lose, but... 
This is kind of embarrassing, {LF}but I have a really bad habit.
I'm careful when I'm in front of{LF}other people, so it's not that{LF}bad but,
when I'm alone with my thoughts,{LF}before I know it, my knees start{LF}shaking.
This is kind of embarrassing {LF}but I have this nasty habit of{LF}putting pens in my mouth.
Dorothy always catches me doing it.
It's really impolite, so I'd like{LF}to try and stop, but... 
I'm afraid of every kind of snake.
I'm afraid of every kind of spider.
I'm afraid of every kind of slug.
I'm thinking that in the future I'd{LF}like to make a name for myself in{LF}the field of natural sciences.
Natural sciences?
It's the branch of science devoted{LF}to explaining the mysteries of nature.
Wow... that sounds pretty hard.{LF}But I hope you realize your dream.
Thank you, teehee!|
I'm thinking that I'd like to{LF}do some sort of work that{LF}will contribute to society.
Like what?
Hmm, well...{LF}Like researching some way to{LF}harvest runes for energy.
If I did something like that,{LF}I could give back not only to{LF}society, but also to the land... 
It's a very ambitious dream.
At any rate, I hope you realize it.
Thank you, teehee!|
Sometimes I think that I'd like to{LF}dedicate my life to academia, but on{LF}the other hand, sometimes I just{LF}think about having a family.
A happy family....{LF}There's something fascinating{LF}about all the different types of{LF}happy couples out there.
I see. So it'll be nice if you{LF}get to meet a really great guy!
Exactly!
(Whoa, why is she looking{LF}at me like that?)
I've been really forgetful lately...
What sort of stuff have{LF}you been forgetting?
I've can't even remember how many{LF}calories were in that breakfast I ate{LF}six months ago... I'm really losing it.
............
I've been really forgetful lately...
What sort of stuff have{LF}you been forgetting?
I can't even remember what I{LF}said when I bumped into Dorothy{LF}six months ago... I'm really losing it.
..................
I've been really forgetful lately...
What sort of stuff have{LF}you been forgetting?
I can't even remember what {LF}I ate for dinner 120 days ago...{LF}I must be losing my mind.

I'm very depressed right now.
What in the world happened?{LF}Is there anything I can do to help?
Thank you.{LF}Well...
These stockings that I really love{LF}have a bunch of runs in them... 
Well...there's nothing I{LF}can do about that.
*sniffle*
I'm very depressed right now.
What in the world happened?{LF}Is there anything I can do to help?
Thank you.{LF}Well...
I got soy sauce on{LF}my favorite scarf.
Well... There's nothing I{LF}can do about that.
*sniffle*
I'm very depressed right now.
What in the world happened?{LF}Is there anything I can do to help?
Thank you.{LF}Well...
They debuted this really wonderful{LF}show at my favorite theatre, and{LF}the actor I really like...
had a girlfriend!
Well... There's nothing I{LF}can do about that.
I was so let down... *sniffle*
This is kind of a strange question,{LF}but have you ever given any{LF}thought to getting married {LF}some day, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Of course.
It's good to see that you're healthy, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}There's nothing more important to me.
I...see.
Oh!{LF}So is there any lady in particular{LF}that you've got your sights on?
Haha, well... I've, uh, got{LF}to get back to work.
Ahhh! Trying to dodge the question,{LF}are you?
This is kind of a strange question,{LF}but have you ever given any{LF}thought to getting married {LF}some day, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Of course.
Ah. Well, I suppose there's no rush{LF}to think about things like that.
Oh!{LF}So is there any lady in particular{LF}that you've got your sights on?
Haha, well... So, I wonder what I{LF}should have for lunch today...
Shall I prepare something for you?
And then you can take your time{LF}and tell me all about this...
Hahaha... 
This is kind of a strange question,{LF}but have you ever given any{LF}thought to getting married {LF}some day, ＠カイル＠＠?
Not yet.
Of course.
I...see.
Oh!{LF}So is there any lady in particular{LF}that you've got your sights on?
Haha. Well, uh, I've gotta be{LF}heading home. Time for bed...
Ahh! Now I'm going to be up all night{LF}wondering! You're cruel!
If I don't eat something soon, my{LF}stomach's going to start growling.
Well, I guess it's natural, {LF}so even if I wanted to there's {LF}nothing I could do about it.
But still, I'd like to avoid{LF}doing something so rude and{LF}embarrassing in front of you...
(*rumble*)
!!!
Ugggh... I can't believe that{LF}happened. I'm so embarrassed!
Rosalind... that was my{LF}stomach just now.
Huh? That sound was your stomach?
The timing was so perfect... I guess{LF}I didn't even really consider that.
Can I tell you something?{LF}I kind of did something really{LF}silly...
It happened two days ago...{LF}I was doing some exercises{LF}to stretch my legs...
and I was in the middle of{LF}some straddled stretches...
when my brother came in.{LF}Without even knocking.
So then,
my brother took one look at{LF}me in the middle of a stretch
and his jaw dropped and he{LF}started laughing hysterically{LF}and ran away.
Since then I haven't been{LF}able to look him in the eye.
You let these sorts of things{LF}get to you too much, Rosalind.
You guys are siblings.
That sort of thing will just make{LF}for a funny story later on.
I'm honestly a bit jealous that{LF}you have someone like that...
I guess you're right.{LF}When I think about it{LF}like that,
I realize that messing up isn't{LF}always the worst thing in the world.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!|
Can I tell you something?{LF}I kind of did something really{LF}silly...
Hmm? What happened?{LF}I'll listen if you want.
Thank you.
So I have this habit of counting{LF}sheep in my head when I'm{LF}having trouble falling asleep.
Mmmhmm.
But!
The truth is, I noticed that up{LF}until now, I've been counting{LF}the sheep out loud.
And I think my brother must{LF}have seen or at least heard{LF}me doing it at some point...
Ahhhh... I just want to{LF}crawl into a hole somewhere.
Ahaha, you've been letting {LF}yourself get upset about {LF}something as silly as that?
Counting sheep because you{LF}can't fall asleep... that sounds{LF}more cute than anything.
I love that silly side of you, Rosalind.
Heh... you love it?! Stop,{LF}you're making me blush!
＠カイル＠＠, do you know{LF}about the Forest of Beginnings?
I don't know too much about it{LF}either, but I hear it's a place{LF}where the spirits live.
＠カイル＠＠, are you familiar{LF}with the concept of parallel{LF}worlds?
Well, imagine multiple worlds existing{LF}in almost the same physical space,{LF}but existing in their own separate{LF}realities.
Under normal circumstances, those{LF}two realities would never cross paths.
But with magic, it's possible to open{LF}a gateway between the two worlds.
That's what has happened around here.{LF}Wild magic keeps opening gateways to{LF}another world. The world of the{LF}Forest of Beginnings.
That's where all of these monsters{LF}come from. And unless we can close the{LF}gates for good, the monsters will{LF}keep coming.
I see...
Do you know where{LF}monsters come from, ＠カイル＠＠?
Nope, no idea.
They're all originally inhabitants{LF}of the spirit world, known as{LF}the Forest of Beginnings. 
It's said that for a variety of{LF}reasons, they morph into{LF}physical matter and come {LF}interfere in our world.
＠カイル＠＠, are there any things{LF}that you wished we had in this town?
Maybe a museum?
Maybe places for people to stay?
For sure. If we had somewhere like{LF}that, I think I'd go there every day.
Well, it's really rare that any{LF}sightseers ever come through here.
Even if we had one, I can't{LF}imagine that it would get much {LF}business...
＠カイル＠＠, what do you think{LF}is the biggest thing that we could{LF}do to make this town better?
There's really nothing.
We might need a school.
Really?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Hmm... so you think that the{LF}town is perfectly fine as it is?
Definitely. We do{LF}need a school here.
You can teach morals and{LF}ethics in the home, but you can't{LF}really be very academic there.
What do you think this town{LF}is lacking, ＠カイル＠＠?
Well, what do you think it is?
I think we need to do more{LF}things to prepare for a disaster.
There have been a lot of{LF}earthquakes lately, no?
I think that everyone should be{LF}making preparations in case{LF}it gets really bad.
There are some people that can{LF}understand the feelings of the{LF}land spirits from birth. {LF}They're called Earthmates.
An Earthmate is what you would{LF}call a spokesman for the land spirits.
 ＠カイル＠＠, I think
that you might be an Earthmate.
Me?
Yes. The way you look when{LF}you're working in the fields...
You and the land...you look{LF}like two friends having a conversation.
Now that you mention it...{LF}
When I'm plowing the fields or{LF}planting seeds and stuff, I do{LF}start feeling very warm inside.
Runes are the power of the land{LF}itself. They are the source{LF}of all the life in this world.
Humans shouldn't think that they can{LF}keep exploiting the land as much as{LF}they please.
We need to also give{LF}the land the freedom it{LF}needs to bring forth runes. 
To do that... 
To do that, people must learn to live{LF}with the land, and not recklessly{LF}destroy what nature has created. 
When the sun goes down {LF}and the whole town{LF}is enveloped by darkness {LF}and silence...
Even then I think{LF}about the things I'm growing.
Well, that's because you're{LF}a true farmer.
＠カイル＠＠, are you familiar with{LF}the legend of the Elder Dragons?
Lots of people say that some cultures{LF}worshipped them alongside the land{LF}spirits, and they actually visited{LF}humans through the Earthmates.
＠カイル＠＠, are you familiar with{LF}the legend of the Elder Dragons?
Yeah, I've heard a bit about it.
Some people say one actually appeared{LF}in the town of Kardia?
Yes. I heard that one destroyed the{LF}invading imperial army.
Do you think it was trying to protect{LF}the town?
No one is really sure.
When I hear the name "Elder Dragon,"{LF}I always get scared and excited at{LF}the same time.
I hope that we can keep being{LF}such close friends, ＠カイル＠＠.
Of course. I'll make sure of it.
Although honestly, I don't{LF}think it'll be too hard.
Me neither!
I hope that we can keep being{LF}such close friends, ＠カイル＠＠.
Of course. I'll make sure of it.
Although honestly, I don't{LF}think it'll be too hard.
Me neither!|
I hope that we can keep being{LF}such close friends, ＠カイル＠＠.

Although honestly, I don't{LF}think it'll be too hard.
Me neither!|
＠アルス＠＠, you can't just{LF}think you can learn everything {LF}from a book.
You need to go outside.
The townspeople, the trees {LF}and the flowers, the animals... {LF}Everything out there forms{LF}the foundation of your life.
You going to hang out with{LF}your mom today, ＠アルス＠＠?
There's nothing I treasure more{LF}than your smile, ＠アルス＠＠?
Are you having a good{LF}time at school, ＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠, I know you might{LF}not have any real memories of{LF}your father, but... 
Back in the day, he used to go{LF}out to the fields just like that.{LF}So, if you spend time with the crops,
I'm sure you'll be able to{LF}sense your dad at your side.
You look very well today, ＠アルス＠＠.
Make sure not to get hurt.
I'll always be looking out for you{LF}no matter what, ＠アルス＠＠.
Don't forget that.
Are you having a good time{LF}at school, ＠アルス＠＠? Make{LF}sure to listen to your teachers.
I've been feeling a strange{LF}uneasiness lately...
I wonder why that is. I can't{LF}think of a reason.
............{LF}............
＠アルス＠＠...
Please, don't ever leave me alone.
Look after your mom, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good morning, honey.
Did you sleep well last night?
I, um... 
I just couldn't{LF}get to sleep at all, so...{LF}I'm really tired out.
Oh, really?{LF}Then why don't we sleep{LF}holding hands tonight?
Really?{LF}Oh... Yes, okay!
Come on, doesn't it make you{LF}feel safe to hold hands?{LF}You'll sleep much better.
Of course. You're right!
When couples can't sleep,{LF}if they go to sleep holding hands, then{LF}it melts away stress and{LF}they drift right off to sleep.
Oh, I've read about that in a research{LF}report somewhere!
We'll just have to put it{LF}to the test tonight!
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}Okay, then. Tonight{LF}let's go to sleep holding hands!
Okay!
Tonight let's go to sleep{LF}holding each other's hands!
Okay!
Have you noticed anything different?
Huh?{LF}Well... 
Oh, come on!{LF}Look closely at the floor and windows!
Oh!{LF}They're really shiny.{LF}Of course!　{LF}You cleaned them!
I sure did.{LF}You should have seen the giant{LF}dust bunnies I found in the corners!{LF}It was really dirty!
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't believe you...{LF}And you pay such close{LF}attention to detail when{LF}you're working in the fields...
But when it comes to taking care of{LF}yourself, you don't care at all!
You just can't survive without me, {LF}can you, sweetie?|
No.{LF}I don't know what I'd do without you!|
You just can't survive without me, {LF}can you, sweetie?|
No.{LF}I don't know what I'd do without you!|
I brought some lithograph{LF}prints from my house.
Oh, yeah. Those pictures{LF}hanging in the bedroom?{LF}I noticed those.
What do you think?
I think they look nice.{LF}This room is kind of dreary.{LF}It could use a little color, I think.
It is.
Lithograph prints...{LF}Maybe I should try painting something.
Oh, that would be great!
Honey!
Wh-What?!
I was straightening up the bookshelves{LF}and look what I found!
Oh... Oh, that's just... 
What is this?! I found this sketch of some{LF}girl and this piece of a note!
Judging from the color of her hair...{LF}this looks like a sketch of Mana!!
I can't believe you! You were sneaking {LF}around with Mana behind{LF}my back!
You're awful!{LF}I just can't bear it!!
Rosalind...{LF}take a closer look at that picture.
The colors have faded over time,{LF}but originally the hair was colored{LF}cyan, you see?
Well, then... {LF}So that must have been...?
That's right!　{LF}That's your hair color!
This is something your brother{LF}secretly gave me.
It's something I've always{LF}carried with me.
Really?!
When my crops dried up and I felt {LF}depressed, or when I couldn't {LF}remember my past and I felt all {LF}alone, frustrated and discouraged...
Your smiling face in this picture,{LF}so full of compassion and {LF}understanding, always gave me {LF}courage and strength to carry on.
But now that I can{LF}call you my wife,{LF}I don't need this picture anymore.
Oh, I see...{LF}I'm sorry...{LF}I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions...
It's okay.{LF}Actually, it makes me happy{LF}to see how much{LF}you really love me.
I do. I really do love you,{LF}honey.
I'm sorry...{LF}I really jumped to conclusions.
It's okay.
Sweetie?
Yes?
You know those potted flowers?{LF}I haven't done anything much for them,{LF}yet pests don't bother them.
Don't you find that strange?
I'm an Earthmate!{LF}So they probably can sense my power!
Oh, you think so?
Yes!
Okay, okay...{LF}whatever you say.
*giggle|*
Oh dear.{LF}You still have dirt on your fingers.
I wonder why?{LF}It must be especially difficult to wash off.
Even after all that scrubbing{LF}in the bath last night.
I know.
You've got to scrub even more.
Ok.
Honey?
Huh?{LF}What is it, Princess?
I'd love to have some of your homemade{LF}cooking sometimes...
Oh, really?{LF}Well, then I'll have to treat you to my{LF}cooking sometime!
Really?{LF}Is that a promise?
Of course!
Oh, I can't wait!!|
Your very own cooking!{LF}I'm really looking forward to it!|
Um, honey?
What's wrong?{LF}You look really pale!
Lately, I've been feeling{LF}kind of bad...{LF}I've got an upset stomach.
Oh no, are you going to be okay?
Oh, yes.{LF}I think I'll be okay.
Well, okay...{LF}But don't overdo it, okay?
Ok. Thanks.
Don't overdo it, okay?
Okay. Thanks,{LF}honey.
There's a letter here for you{LF}from my brother.
I wonder what it could be?{LF}Let's see it...
"Dear ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}How are you doing?"
"I hope you're getting along well{LF}with Rosalind!"
"I really value your {LF}company and energy."
"I hope you come back to the{LF}de Sainte-Coquille homestead soon{LF}with your family."
"Then you can help me{LF}start my business plan!"
"I'll be waiting!{LF}Peace!"
That's all he says.
It seems like my brother{LF}has really taken to you, too.
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}I don't know what to say.
It seems like my brother{LF}has really taken to you, too.
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}I don't know what to say.
Our baby is really{LF}lively.
When I sit very still{LF}I can feel it moving inside me.
It's sure to be a wild little tike!{LF}(giggle)|
You're finally starting to build{LF}the school.
That's right.{LF}I'm going to build a great school building.{LF}For ＠アルス＠＠'s sake, too.
Good luck!
Oh, that reminds me.{LF}Byron will only talk about{LF}that when he's on the first floor{LF}of our house.
I'm going to build a great school building.{LF}For ＠アルス＠＠'s sake, too.
Good luck!
Byron will only talk about{LF}that when he's on the first floor{LF}of our house.{LF}So be careful.
This earthquake-resistant construction{LF}that I invented should make it safe{LF}even if we have an earthquake.
Oh, honey. Let's hurry{LF}and go see the school!
The children's school.
Honey,{LF}I have something important to tell you.
What?
Well, I, um, we're{LF}going to have a baby.
What? Really?!{LF}That's great!{LF}Oh, wow! I'm so happy, Rosalind!
I am, too.
I can't believe it! Our baby?{LF}Our very own baby...?{LF}I wonder if it's a {LF}boy or a girl? 
Oh, I wonder, too!{LF}Which do you hope for?
I hope it's a boy.
I hope it's a girl.
Either is fine.
I guess I'd like a boy.{LF}What about you, Rosalind?
I guess I'd like a girl.{LF}What about you, Rosalind?
Either way, I couldn't be happier!{LF}What about you, Rosalind?
*giggle|*{LF}Me too.
Wow, our family{LF}is growing.
That's right, so keep working hard,{LF}honey.
Of course!
Honey, I think the baby{LF}will arrive soon!
Honey, our baby{LF}is here!
You did a great job, Rosalind!
Yes.{LF}Look. It's a boy.{LF}He looks just like you.
Yes.{LF}Look. It's a girl.{LF}She looks just like you.
She has her daddy's hair.
She has her mommy's{LF}pouty little lips.
We need to think of a name.{LF}A really good name.
＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Yes.{LF}That's a great name.{LF}I like that.
Oh, good!
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}eat lots and grow up{LF}big and strong!
Growing up... Hmmm.
What is it?
Well.{LF}I think the children{LF}are going to need a proper{LF}place to go to school.
That's true.{LF}We really need a school.
I'll go tell Byron that{LF}the baby is here, and I'll talk to {LF}him about building a school, too.
Okay.{LF}Good luck, honey.{LF}It's the best thing for ＠アルス＠＠.
Yes!
Oh, dear.{LF}What's wrong?
It makes Mommy{LF}so happy when I{LF}see your smile, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}
Play nicely with your friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Get outside and try doing lots of{LF}different things.
Everything will{LF}be a lesson for life,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
If your friend has a problem,{LF}always lend a hand,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Always treat others the way{LF}that you want to be treated.
I can't believe you're already {LF}going to school{LF}at the school your father built...
And you've become such {LF}a good student.{LF}I'm so proud of you.
Thank you for helping{LF}clean up the room.{LF}That really helps Mommy.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}These vegetables that you grew{LF}are delicious!
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}it's easy to slip in the bath,{LF}so no running.
No running{LF}in the bath.{LF}It's dangerous.
Let's get a bath{LF}and get all clean.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}did you come for a bath?
Mommy loves her bath.{LF}＠アルス＠＠, do you like{LF}your bath, too?
I bet you like bathtime, too,{LF}don't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
＠アルス＠＠, you like things to{LF}be clean, don't you?{LF}That's a healthy habit.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}did you come for a bath?{LF}It's really cold out, isn't it?		
I love to come here{LF}and feel the gentle sea breeze.{LF}It's makes you forget all your troubles.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}That sea breeze feels great, doesn't it?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}the ocean is right in front of you,{LF}but no jumping in, okay?
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Play nicely with the girls, okay?
If something is bothering you,{LF}don't bottle it up inside.{LF}You can talk to your mom about anything.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.
You really love this{LF}ocean, just like your{LF}mom and dad.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}The wind is really strong at the harbor.{LF}It makes it feel even colder.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Make yourself comfortable.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}It's pretty hot here in the summer.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}How's school going?
Be nice to the girls, okay?
This place is a nice respite from{LF}the cold outside.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you haven't been going outside{LF}the village have you?
No.
No.
Really?{LF}Well, that's good to hear.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you haven't been going outside{LF}the village have you?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you have a lot of bruises and cuts{LF}lately, but you haven't been doing{LF}anything dangerous, have you?
No. I never do anything{LF}that's dangerous.{LF}Don't worry, Mom.
No.{LF}No. I never do anything{LF}that's dangerous.{LF}Don't worry, Mom.
Really?{LF}Well, that's good to hear.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you have a lot of bruises and cuts{LF}anything dangerous, have you?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I saw you leaving with{LF}a weapon. What was that for?
Oh, uh...{LF}that was a sword that I borrowed{LF}from my teacher, Barrett.
Oh, uh...{LF}that was a sword that I borrowed{LF}from my teacher, Barrett.
A borrowed sword?{LF}You only borrowed it?{LF}I hope you didn't try{LF}swinging it around, or anything?
Of course not!{LF}And, anyway, I returned it.
No.{LF}And, anyway, I returned it.
Really?{LF}Well, that's good to hear.
Don't ever mess around in the{LF}monster-infested areas around{LF}here, ＠アルス＠＠.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}Just be careful.{LF}That's all I want to say...
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}Be very careful.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}It may be my imagination, but{LF}you seem calmer than you used to.
You certainly have grown{LF}into a strong boy.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}It may be my imagination, but{LF}you seem calmer than you used to.
Look who came back!
I always knew you would.{LF}I always knew the three of us would be {LF}together again as a happy family!
＠カイル＠＠ came back! Isn't that{LF}wonderful, ＠アルス＠＠?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you're certainly in good spirits!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}watch where you're going when you run.
Good job, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You really do nice work.
This is the ＠アイテム９＠?
Ah, excellent.{LF}This will definitely{LF}prove that I defeated{LF}a monster.
This will stop all the stupid gossip{LF}that I'm just a braggart who can't{LF}actually fight!
Oh, um...
Well, um...
Oh,　You're still here?
Oh, that's right!{LF}I still have to pay you.{LF}How rude...
Here's{LF}＠数字９＠ G for your payment.
You got ＠数字９＠G.{LF}
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I don't mind getting{LF}presents, but{LF}I really don't need this right now.
So, ＠カイル＠＠, are you really sure{LF}that you want to marry my sister?
Yes!
Very well, then.{LF}Here you are.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Wow... 100 roses!{LF}That should make an impression!
Now go and give those to Rosalind!
Okay, I will!
I'm afraid that's not quite enough {LF}TOMATOES, ＠カイル＠＠.
I can't trade a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}for that.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I don't mind getting{LF}presents, but{LF}I really don't need this right now.
I really don't need any more tomatoes.　{LF}I've got plenty.{LF}Besides, you should really hurry along{LF}and go meet Rosalind.{LF}She's probably waiting for you.
Thanks!{LF}But it really would have been perfect{LF}for a birthday present.
Thanks!{LF}But it really would have been perfect{LF}for a birthday present.
Oh, it's ＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?{LF}Thanks!　I'm thrilled!{LF}I'm so glad you got this for me.
Oh, it's ＠アイテム９＠!{LF}I'm thrilled!{LF}Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}That's enough.{LF}Thanks.{LF}I've got plenty now.
Uh, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}That's enough.{LF}Thanks.{LF}I've got plenty now.
What's this? Are you{LF}giving this to me?
Oh, I see. Of course.{LF}In that case, I humor you and{LF}drain it right here before your eyes!!
Mmmm.{LF}Well...
It's a little peculiar, but{LF}it doesn't taste bad.
But, you're a pretty{LF}stubborn one, too.
Not that I mind{LF}that about you, though.
Thanks, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I'm thrilled!{LF}I'll just go right ahead{LF}and drink it now.
Mmm. This tastes great!
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
Really? Thanks!
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
Really? Thanks!{LF}It looks fluffy and warm.
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
You knew just what to get me!{LF}I'm so glad you got this for me!
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
Really? Thanks!
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
Really? Thanks!{LF}It looks fluffy and warm.
This must be{LF}＠アイテム９＠!{LF}Is it for me?
You knew just what to get me!{LF}I'm so glad you got this for me!
This is nothing{LF}to laugh about.
This is nothing{LF}to laugh about.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I don't mind getting presents, but{LF}I really don't need this right now.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}I don't mind getting presents, but{LF}I really don't need this right now.
Hey, I'm Max.
Nice to meet you.{LF}My name is ＠カイル＠＠.
My name's Max. I'm second in{LF}charge of the de Sainte-Coquille{LF}family.
Uh, okay.
By the way, what's your name?
(Uh, I just told you, but...){LF}My name is ＠カイル＠＠.
＠カイル＠＠, huh? Now that's a{LF}name I can remember!
My name's Max.{LF}Don't forget it, now!
Okay.
Here, I'll tell you again, so{LF}you don't forget. I'm Max.{LF}Max de Sainte-Coquille, okay?
One more time, so you don't forget!
MAX!
DE!
SAINTE-COQUILLE!
Yes, yes! I got it! Max!
What are you so mad about?
I'm not mad at all...{LF}Sorry, but I've got to go...
Do you know about{LF}"Monster Companions"?
I do.
Never heard of them.
Well, that's good.
"Monster Companions" are monsters{LF}who will fight with you and do work{LF}for you on the farm.
If you have to fight monsters and are worried{LF}about being outnumbered, I recommend {LF}taking along a "Monster Companion."
The "Pet Glove" holds{LF}a clue to getting{LF}a "Monster Companion."
So, first get the{LF}"Pet Glove."
Unfortunately, I have no idea{LF}where the {LF}"Pet Glove" is.
I think if you keep checking{LF}the requests on the bulletin board
sooner or later you'll{LF}manage to find it.
And I'm not just talking about{LF}the "Pet Glove."
If you listen to what people in the{LF}village say, and offer your help,
the villagers will offer you useful items{LF}in exchange.{LF}
In other words, it's important to have{LF}a cooperative attitude!
Cicadas always make me think of summer.
Although they can be a little loud...
Autumn is the harvest season.{LF}You'd better work hard too.
I'm counting on you.
When I see the village transformed{LF}by it's pure white blanket of snow,
I feel like all the suffering and{LF}troubles of the year are wiped away.
Well, your backpack{LF}looks okay, so{LF}here, take this.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}it looks like you haven't{LF}cleaned out your backpack yet.
Throw away the stuff you don't need{LF}and make room for one more item,{LF}then come back and{LF}talk to me again.
＠カイル＠＠, are you searching for{LF}a ＠アイテム９＠ for my sister?{LF}
Yes, I am!　But... 
Max, you wouldn't know where I could{LF}find a ＠アイテム９＠, would you?
Indeed I do.{LF}I have a ＠アイテム９＠ {LF}right here with me.
You do?!{LF}What do you want for it?
Don't worry about it.{LF}I'll give it to you.{LF}For free.
Wow!{LF}Thank you very much.
Oh, but, I'm sorry!{LF}I forgot that my backpack{LF}is all full.{LF}I'll go clean it out and come back.
I got: ＠アイテム９＠.
You're a great help, Max.{LF}But I don't know. I feel bad{LF}getting this rare ingredient{LF}from you for nothing.
Ha ha ha. It's nothing.{LF}It's a small investment compared{LF}to the returns I'm expecting{LF}in the future.
Oh?
Ha ha ha! Never mind.{LF}I'm just talking to myself.{LF}Don't mind me.
Well, your backpack{LF}has room, so{LF}here, take this.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}it looks like you haven't{LF}cleaned out your backpack yet.
Throw away the stuff you don't need{LF}and make room for one more item,{LF}then come back and{LF}talk to me again.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You look a bit panicked.{LF}Is something wrong?
Yes. Well, sort of. I have to find{LF}this rare food called{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
But I have no idea where I'm going{LF}to get some.
Hmmm. So you're looking for a dish{LF}that looks like this?
Oh!　Is that it?!{LF}That looks like it might{LF}be ＠アイテム９＠!
Mm-hmm.{LF}It is indeed.
Wow!{LF}Max!{LF}Could you give it to me, please?
Well, okay.{LF}I'll give it to you.{LF}For free.
You will?!　Wow!{LF}Thank you very much.
Oh, but, I'm sorry!{LF}I forgot that my backpack{LF}is all full.{LF}I'll go clean it out and come back.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠.
You're a huge help, Max!
Wow! I can't believe you had this{LF}ROYAL CURRY just sitting around!{LF}I feel so lucky!
Oh, it's not just luck.
What?
Well, let's just say I know what{LF}that curry means to you and my{LF}sister. And I approve.
You do?
Well, don't you have to deliver that{LF}curry to someone special?{LF}Off you go now!
Be sure it gets eaten{LF}before it gets cold.
Max...
I just can't thank you enough!
Don't give it a second thought!
Alright!{LF}Now you got it.
Well, off you go now!{LF}Be sure it gets eaten{LF}before it gets cold.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠!
I can tell Rosalind is thinking about{LF}you a lot these days.
You two really seem to be spending{LF}quite a lot of time together.
Yeah. Rosalind is really special{LF}to me.
Hmm.
You certainly have been a good{LF}influence her. I've never seen her{LF}this cheerful and outgoing.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.　{LF}I really appreciate it.{LF}I hope you'll continue to{LF}look after Rosalind.
I will.
Oh, another thing...{LF}It's probably none of my business, but...
My sister has always hoped for a true{LF}fairytale romance.
I still remember her favorite story{LF}growing up.
At the end of it, a red-haired knight{LF}on a white horse presents the princess with a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}and sweeps her off her feet.
That story...
Being swept off her feet by a{LF}man with a bouquet of roses...
Well, I know that's something Rosalind{LF}has always hoped that the man who{LF}would be her husband would do for her.
In other words, a{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}has a special meaning for Rosalind.
So...
If you're really serious about{LF}Rosalind, and are willing to do{LF}whatever it takes to make her happy...
You need to bring her a bouquet of{LF}100 roses.
Really? But where am I going to{LF}find that many roses?
Hmm.　＠カイル＠＠, have you ever{LF}grown tomatoes on your farm?
Uh...tomatoes?
That's right, tomatoes. I love them.{LF}There's nothing better than a ripe{LF}TOMATO, fresh from the vine.{LF}I want you to bring me nine of them.
What! Nine TOMATOES?!
That's right.{LF}Then we'll do a swap.
See, here's the deal.
The flower that looks the most like{LF}the one from the illustration in{LF}the fairytale is a variety called {LF}the "Geschule."
So you'll want a bouquet of those.
However, a single "Geschule" flower{LF}goes for 68000G at the market.
What?! Flowers can be that expensive?
They can indeed. However, I can get{LF}them without much trouble.
But if I just give it to you for free,{LF}it won't mean anything when you give{LF}it to Rosalind.
A gift that costs you no money,{LF}thought, or effort has no value,{LF}no matter how perfect it is otherwise.
So you have to give me a fair price{LF}for the bouquet. What you want most{LF}is my sister's hand in marriage, so{LF}the bouquet is worth a lot to you.
But what I want most in the world right{LF}now is nine fresh, juicy TOMATOES.{LF}So that will be a fair price for the{LF}bouquet.
I understand what you're saying,{LF}Max.
Nine TOMATOES sounds like a very{LF}fair price!
Hmmm.
Glad to hear it!
When you want that ＠アイテム９＠, {LF}you know where to find me.
Just bring me 9 TOMATOES in exchange.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Hello. What's this?{LF}What are the two of you eating?
Oh, this?{LF}It's Ray's homemade{LF}chestnut cream cake.
No matter how many of these cakes you{LF}eat, you won't get fat!
Really? That sounds like a healthy cake.{LF}I'd love to try some.{LF}If you don't mind,{LF}could you give me the recipe?
Ah....{LF}The cake has a special{LF}secret recipe.
So I can't tell you.
Really?{LF}That's too bad, but I understand.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You came just in time.{LF}Listen to what Ray did...
No, stop it, Max.
Oh come on, why not tell him?
What are you talking about?
Our dreams when we were little.
When Ray was little, he always dreamed...
Well...
He dreamed of becoming a "bride"!
So...{LF}Well...
That's terrific.
Well, it is!{LF}It's nothing to feel bad about.
Ray used to be mistaken{LF}all the time for a girl.
People thought his sister was a boy, and{LF}thought Ray was the little sister!
Ha-ha! I can see how that might happen.
What an awful thing to say, Max!
No, I meant it as a compliment!
What I mean is even a boy who's as{LF}cute as a little girl can grow up into{LF}this handsome young man!{LF}Right, ＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, I suppose.
I know!　{LF}＠カイル＠＠, I bet you would{LF}take Ray as your bride!		
Oh, stop giving ＠カイル＠＠{LF}such a hard time...
(I wonder what Ray would look{LF}like in a wedding dress...)
So.
Well...{LF}
Oh, come on, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Don't tell me you're imaging Ray in a{LF}wedding dress or something{LF}weird like that!
No! No way!{LF}What are you talking about?!{LF}Ha-ha-ha!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Hello.{LF}What's this?　{LF}What are the two of you talking about?
Huh?　Oh, we were talking about a certain{LF}area of medicine that's been{LF}troubling Rosalind.
I know!　Listen, Max.{LF}I may be able to help{LF}Rosalind figure out her problem{LF}with my medical knowledge.
Hmm.{LF}Well, I'll suggest it{LF}to Rosalind.
Ok!　Thanks.
No, wait a minute. Isn't Rosalind{LF}in the next room right now?{LF}Go and tell her right now.
Huh?{LF}Well...{LF}Uh...
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Hello.{LF}What's this?　{LF}What are the two of you talking about?
Just our medical studies.
Max is the only person I can{LF}consult with when I'm having{LF}trouble with my medical studies.
Oh, I see.
The entrance to this manor{LF}always has a certain aromatic{LF}fragrance.
Fragrances are one of{LF}my father's hobbies.
Take a nice, deep breath.
Doesn't it smell nice?
It's roses. Don't you think{LF}it's the perfect floral{LF}scent for spring?
Not to brag about my own family,{LF}but my father is really quite{LF}good at creating fragrances!
Take a nice deep breath.
Doesn't it smell nice?
It's peppermint.{LF}Don't you think it's the perfect{LF}refreshing aroma for summer?
Not to brag about my own family,{LF}but my father is really quite{LF}good at creating fragrances!
Take a nice deep breath.
Doesn't it smell nice?
It's orange.{LF}Don't you think it's the perfect{LF}sweet scent for autumn?
Not to brag about my own family,{LF}but my father is really quite{LF}good at creating fragrances!
Take a nice deep breath.
Doesn't it smell nice?
It's rosewood.{LF}Don't you think it's the perfect{LF}woody aroma for winter?
Not to brag about my own family,{LF}but my father is really quite{LF}good at creating fragrances!
Using your backpack carelessly{LF}will fill it up really quickly.{LF}You'll run into trouble when {LF}you start to run out of room.
It's something I need to remember, too.
You should make it a habit to organize{LF}your backpack every day.
To auto-arrange things in your{LF}backpack...
First press START to go to the pause{LF}menu, then put the pointer anywhere{LF}in the Backpack section.
Then press SELECT.
This will auto-arrange all of the{LF}things in your backpack.
All items of the same type will be{LF}put together in groups of up to 9.
Men who keep their things in order {LF}are popular with the ladies...
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I understand that you don't remember {LF}before you arrived here.
That's really too bad, but{LF}there's no reason to feel bad about it.
You just need to build new memories{LF}here in this village.
The west side of this road{LF}faces the ocean.{LF}You can really enjoy it's{LF}clear, emerald green water.
Not many people come by here, so{LF}it's a perfect spot when you want{LF}some time to think by yourself.
The ornament on our gate post{LF}is the image of a phoenix.
Take advantage of your{LF}opponent's weak point.{LF}That's probably the single most {LF}important technique for any battle.
So what specifically does it mean{LF}to take advantage of a weak point?
A weak point is created when{LF}someone doesn't pay attention{LF}to his surroundings and doesn't{LF}use enough caution.
So, to take advantage of a weak point,{LF}creep up on your opponent without{LF}being noticed, and then strike{LF}during that moment of surprise.
At this moment and in the future,{LF}you'll want to master this technique{LF}for those times that you encounter and{LF}battle monsters.
So, what do you need to do to create{LF}a situation where a monster{LF}doesn't notice you?
When you understand that,{LF}you'll have an enormous advantage{LF}when fighting against{LF}a monster.
When humans, animals, or monsters{LF}receive a blow to the head,{LF}it can often stun them.
Heavy weapons like axes and battle{LF}hammers are more likely to stun{LF}your opponent than light weapons{LF}like shortswords.
When a monster is stunned, you'll see{LF}stars above its head, and it won't{LF}be able to move or attack.
That gives you an excellent opening{LF}to attack again.
It's also easier to handle a group{LF}of monsters if you can stun one or{LF}two of them.
So you see, each weapon has its{LF}own uses and advantages.
It's important to master each and{LF}every one.
Don't just stick with the shortsword{LF}because it's the easiest to handle!
This one is good to use when{LF}you have some time to kill on your own.
Even I have times when{LF}I have nothing to do.
The snow covered park{LF}has a charm about it that's really nice.
You can catch{LF}＠アイテム９＠ in this harbor{LF}this time of the year.
Why don't you give it a try?
You can catch{LF}＠アイテム９＠ in this harbor{LF}this time of the year.
Why don't you give it a try?
You can catch{LF}＠アイテム９＠ in this harbor{LF}this time of the year.
Why don't you give it a try?
You can catch{LF}＠アイテム９＠ in this harbor{LF}this time of the year.
Why don't you give it a try?
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.
Tee-hee-hee!
Hello.
Hey, what are you giggling about?
Tee-hee-hee!
Pretty odd, isn't she?
Ha ha ha!
Yo!{LF}If it isn't ＠カイル＠＠!
Hello there, Max, Julia.{LF}What are the two of you doing?
Julia asked me to tell her about all{LF}the ships anchored in this harbor,{LF}and in exchange she's admirably{LF}listening to all my stories.
He-heh-heh!
Really?
Well, I'm not sure exactly how much{LF}she actually understands, but...
He-heh-heh!
Yo, ＠カイル＠＠!
Hello,{LF}Max, Julia
I've heard you can catch{LF}＠アイテム９＠ {LF}in this harbor.
Really?
Well since you asked, I'm not{LF}absolutely sure, since I only{LF}heard it from Julia...
He-heh-heh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Yo, ＠カイル＠＠!
Hello, Max.{LF}Hello, Julie.
He-heh-heh!
Uh...
What are you staring at?
Oh, nothing.{LF}You and Julia just{LF}look like you're getting along well.
Sure.{LF}We're good friends.
Ha-ha-ha! ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I'm known in this village for getting {LF}along well with all the girls.
Isn't that right?{LF}All you little girls just love{LF}Max, don't you?
You know... {LF}I just can't help being charmed by{LF}all the girls of this world and{LF}the beauty and talent they're born with!
Uh...{LF}Well...
When I get in the bath a strange thing{LF}happens and my body feels like{LF}it's being filled with runes.
Since I like to wear long sleeves even {LF}in the summer, I have to take several{LF}baths a day or I get all sticky with sweat.
I have a thing for cleanliness and{LF}I have to keep my body clean at all {LF}times or I just don't feel right.
On cold days, I just want{LF}to spend all my spare time{LF}relaxing in a nice{LF}warm bath.
Morning. My name's Max. Don't{LF}forget it, now!
Oh, hello.{LF}I'm Max.{LF}Don't forget it.
Oh, good evening.{LF}I'm Max.{LF}Don't forget it.
Oh, good morning.{LF}I'm Max.
Oh, hello.{LF}I'm Max.
Oh, good evening.{LF}I'm Max.
Oh. Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh. Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.
Oh. Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking strong and healthy{LF}as usual.
Good afternoon, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking strong and healthy{LF}as usual.
Good evening, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You're looking strong and healthy{LF}as usual.
Morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good afternoon, ＠アルス＠＠.
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Happy New Year, ＠カイル＠＠.
Here's to another{LF}good year!
Happy New Year, ＠アルス＠＠.
I hope you have a{LF}year full of success.
Thanks to my father,{LF}whenever I see cherry blossoms,
I can't help but think of{LF}cherries.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}the Flower Festival is really important.
It one of the best opportunities{LF}to broaden your circle of friends.
You're really something,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
You even beat{LF}Father Gordon and{LF}Mana's father!
So, you're runner-up?{LF}Well you nearly defeated the great glutton.
A consolation prize? I guess that's a{LF}nice name for 3rd place. Well, your{LF}opponents were tough.
Don't let it get you down.{LF}You win some and you lose some.
Today is the Eating Contest.{LF}You've got to enter this one.
Father is hungry to see some worthy{LF}competitors!
So, today is the Eating Contest?{LF}＠アルス＠＠, you need to{LF}win this one for your mother!
Okay!　You did it!{LF}Great job,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Accept your defeat like a good sport.{LF}That's the important thing.{LF}Being able to accept defeat{LF}is the sign of a strong heart.
Next time you'll win the championship!{LF}Right,　＠アルス＠＠!
Look at that red sun!
What a gorgeous blue sky!
A quivering mirage!
Nothing like summertime at the ocean!
＠アルス＠＠!
I'm sure you can't wait to see me{LF}in a sexy pose, wearing my
super low-rise bikini,{LF}right?
No, I really, really,
really, really,
really, don't want to see!{LF}I really don't!{LF}Noooooo!
I really don't want to see!{LF}Noooooo!{LF}Please! Noooooo!{LF}I don't want to see!
Okay!
Congratulations,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Um...so...{LF}what happened to Jake after that?
He must have really been upset.{LF}He threw a big fit, and {LF}started to cry.
After a while he got tired of crying{LF}and just fell asleep.
Really?
It seems like his physical strength is{LF}really a spiritual foundation for him, so{LF}if he temporarily loses his strength,{LF}he doesn't know what to do with himself.
So he gets in a rage, {LF}and shouts and{LF}cries.{LF}It's like he's a big baby.
Jake really needs to work on improving{LF}his spiritual strength more than{LF}his physical strength...
If he doesn't, he'll always be{LF}nothing but a "paper tiger."
But this isn't a simple problem that can{LF}be explained away in a few words...
I wonder, though...{LF}＠カイル＠＠,{LF}maybe you could use you strength to {LF}change Jake!
What?!
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}Oh, you don't have to get stressed out.{LF}Just stay involved{LF}with Jake and be yourself.
Congratulations,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
That was quite an amazing win!{LF}I don't know how you could tame{LF}a monster so fast.
Oh wow! I never dreamed I would win... 
I was just participating{LF}out of a sense of duty...
Congratulations,{LF}Max!
Oh! Thanks!
Well, sometimes these things{LF}happen... 
Well, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}good luck today!
It's the Monster Taming Contest...
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you'd better not participate in this.{LF}It'll really make Rosalind worry.
Congratulations,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You won! That's great!
Congratulations,{LF}＠アルス＠＠! You won!
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}good thing you didn't get hurt.
Too bad you lost, though.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}better luck next time!
Is that what you're wearing to{LF}the dance, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Well, to each his own, I suppose.
Still, I hope you're prepared to{LF}impress the ladies with some fancy{LF}footwork. Nothing impresses a woman{LF}like a man who can dance!
The Dance Festival...{LF}Do you like to dance, {LF}＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I just love dancing!
Congratulations,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
And you even beat Barrett!
He takes his fishing very seriously,{LF}so besting him is no easy feat.
You must have some serious fishing{LF}skills!
You know, I thought I had the{LF}patent on extreme versatility!
Truly, you are a worthy rival!
Congratulations! You're the runner-up!{LF}It's not first place, but it's{LF}nothing to sneeze at!
The consolation prize may be last place, {LF}but it's nothing to get depressed about.
Festivals are all about{LF}having lots of fun!
Fishing is really a battle between man{LF}and fish. I read somewhere once that{LF}the one with the quickest mind wins{LF}the contest.
I don't know if I entirely believe{LF}that. I don't like the thought of{LF}losing a battle of wits with a fish.
As the organizer, my father is{LF}really particular about flavor,{LF}so unless you're really sure of yourself{LF}it's pretty hard to win it.
You're the greatest gourmet in Alvarna!{LF}I'm just amazed.{LF}We've got to take you seriously, {LF}even if you are a kid.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you still need some training{LF}if you want to call yourself the {LF}greatest gourmet in Alvarna!
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠!
I have to congratulate you!{LF}I hear your time in the Adventure{LF}Contest was nothing short of legendary!
Hm. I hear your time was excellent.
Well, congratulations!
Hm. That contest must have been{LF}pretty tough.
You weren't prepared!{LF}Lack of preparation will defeat{LF}even the finest adventurer!
The Adventure Contest?{LF}If you're going to enter, then{LF}I think I'll sit out this time.
Congratulations! You won!
You did such a great job,{LF}I'll give you a kiss on the cheek!
No way!!!
Yuck!
Well...{LF}Uh...{LF}um...
Congratulations! You're runner-up!
Oh, a consolation prize?{LF}But you gave it your best!{LF}Good for you!
Oh, the Adventure Contest is today.{LF}There'll probably be injuries, so I{LF}bet Ray is worried sick.
The Harvest Festival...{LF}We must give special thanks to {LF}the de Sainte-Coquille family{LF}on this day.
After all, if we weren't around to{LF}buy and help ship the vegetables,{LF}so much would go to waste!
Today's the Harvest Festival!{LF}The vegetables you grow are quite {LF}outstanding, ＠アルス＠＠.
Wow, you've got some amazing monsters!{LF}How on earth did{LF}you become friends with such{LF}powerful monsters?
I'd really like to hear{LF}all about it !
Are they all monsters{LF}that aren't too strong{LF}but aren't too weak, and they're{LF}easy to tame?
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I really envy the fact that{LF}you can get along with{LF}monsters at all.
Today's contest is a {LF}match up of our{LF}friendly monsters' power.
Unfortunately, I don't keep any{LF}friendly monsters{LF}of my own.
So there's no way for me to enter.
Congratulations! You won!
You did such a great job,{LF}I'll give you a kiss on the cheek!
No way!!!
Uh...{LF}Um...{LF}Well...
What?{LF}No way! How embarrassing!
Ha-ha-ha!{LF}＠アルス＠＠, you're{LF}kind of shy, aren't you?
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you can even be friends{LF}with monsters...{LF}I really envy you.
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you can even be friends{LF}with monsters...{LF}I really envy you.
I'm sure Rosalind is just{LF}terrified with this contest, too.
＠アルス＠＠, are you{LF}going to enter the{LF}Monster Contest?
The Shooting Star Festival...{LF}I guess occasionally I should{LF}make the first move with the girls.
Why don't you summon your courage{LF}and take a girl{LF}out to watch{LF}the starry night sky?
The Shooting Star Festival?
I have a feeling that tonight{LF}the shooting stars will be even{LF}more dazzling than most years.
Oh, today is the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Are you interested in shooting stars,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Congratulations! You won!{LF}Wow, it really makes a difference{LF}when you've got such polished skills.
Congratulations! You're runner-up!{LF}I guess there's some trick to mining, too?
I was just certain{LF}that you would be the champion...
Oh, the Mining Contest is today.{LF}I thought I might enter, too, but{LF}you look like you're really good at it.
Maybe I'll take a turn{LF}sitting out this time.
Oh, today is the Mining Contest. 
＠アルス＠＠,{LF}if you win the championship,{LF}I'll give you a kiss on the cheek!
The Mining Contest!{LF}Keep digging and{LF}win the championship!
You're really something, ＠アルス＠＠!
Don't worry about it!{LF}Chalk it up to experience, right?
Good luck next year!{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
When the clock strikes midnight,{LF}the new year will begin.
We'll greet the new year in proper form.
In this world we live in we{LF}count one year as four months.
When we talk of greeting the New Year,{LF}we could say we're greeting the {LF}month of Spring that comes{LF}four months after the last Spring.
Well, actually, I've never heard anyone{LF}say it like, {LF}"Greet the New Month of Spring,"{LF}though.
Anyway, the New Year is really{LF}just the next four months, so it's just a{LF}good time to make a fresh start and{LF}make new resolutions for yourself.
That's what it's all about, so{LF}next year set some goals and resolutions{LF}for yourself, ＠アルス＠＠, and{LF}keep your feet on the ground.
My goal for next year is{LF}a serene and innocent heart.{LF}That's it!
Hmm.{LF}It looks like you have enough space{LF}in your backpack.
It looks like you backpack is{LF}still too full.{LF}Come back and talk to me again{LF}after you organize your items.
Ah, ＠カイル＠＠! You're here about{LF}the posting, right?{LF}So, I have a favor to ask you...
Could you deliver this{LF}green vegetable called {LF}＠アイテム９＠ to Jake?
Just like it said on the bulletin board,{LF}I prepared a reward of ＠数字９＠ G.
So, this vegetable is the{LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I leave it to you!
Hmm... {LF}It looks like your backpack{LF}is too full.
Could you organize your items{LF}and come back again?
If you have multiples of the same item{LF}mixed up in your backpack,{LF}you can make more space by stacking{LF}those items in one location.
If you have weapons and armor that you {LF}don't use, you can store them at home on{LF}the "Shelf," and food, produce and seeds{LF}can be stored in the "Refrigerator."
It's also smart to throw away{LF}items you don't need.
Do a nice job and{LF}make room some room in your backpack,{LF}then come back and see me.
I'm counting on you!
You got the ＠アイテム９＠.
Take ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to Jake for me.{LF}I'm counting on you!
Thanks for your hard work,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Here's ＠数字９＠ G for your payment.{LF}Please take it.
＠カイル＠＠{LF}earned{LF}＠数字９＠ G.
Good job. You've been a great help.{LF}I'll be touch when I need you again.
Yo, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}It's kind of sudden,{LF}but let me explain about the{LF}secret mission.
A secret mission?
Yeah. That's right.{LF}Is something bothering you?
Uh, no...
Ok.{LF}Then let me explain.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you head towards {LF}＠マップ９＠ and 
when you get there, defeat an {LF}＠モンスター９＠{LF}and bring back ＠アイテム９＠{LF}as your booty.
So? An easy task, don't you think?
The payback is big!{LF}It's ＠数字９＠G.
As I said, this is a secret mission.{LF}Don't blab about it to anyone else!{LF}Just get in and get the item quietly.
Got it? Good. I'm counting on you!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you head towards {LF}＠マップ９＠ and 
when you get there, defeat ＠モンスター９＠{LF}and bring back one ＠アイテム９＠{LF}as your booty.
＠マップ９＠, just like its{LF}name implies,{LF}is a place where there are dragons.
Enter the Trieste Forest and{LF}continue due north{LF}and you should get there.
Good job. You've been a great help.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠! Let's talk{LF}business!
I want you to help me to measure{LF}the strength of this steel that{LF}I've developed.
Let me explain how to do it.
Here's a steel sheet I had constructed.{LF}Hit this with your sword, and we'll{LF}measure its strength by the extent{LF}of damage that you do.
I'll be the record keeper, and{LF}you carry out the experiment.
You take your sword (the stylus){LF}and continuously hit (tap) {LF}this sheet (the Touch Screen).
Try to keep hitting it as long{LF}as you can.
Do you understand?
Okay, let's begin!{LF}(Touch the Touch Screen with the stylus{LF}to start!)
Okay! That's enough!
Hmm... Its strength is a ＠数字８＠.
Even after all that hitting, I don't{LF}see any obvious scratches.
Fantastic! This is some high-quality{LF}steel!
This is not good. Take a look at{LF}how how much damage was caused{LF}when it was hit.
This prototype is a failure...
Well, thank you. With your help,{LF}I've been able to collect some{LF}valuable data.
Here's ＠数字９＠G for your services.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
Good job. You've been a great help.{LF}I'll be in touch when I need you{LF}again.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠! Let's talk{LF}business!
Remember earlier when I asked for{LF}your help measuring the strength{LF}of some steel?
I would like to continue that{LF}today.
It's the same as the earlier test.{LF}You'll hit this sheet made of steel{LF}with an ordinary sword, and measure{LF}its strength.
I'll be the record keeper, and{LF}you carry out the experiment.
You take your sword (the stylus){LF}and continuously hit (tap) {LF}this sheet (the Touch Screen).
Try to keep hitting it as long{LF}as you can.
Do you understand?
Okay, let's begin!{LF}(Touch the Touch Screen with the stylus{LF}to start!)
Okay! That's enough!
Hmm... Its strength is a ＠数字８＠.
Good, this steel looks to be higher{LF}quality, and its ability to disperse{LF}energy seems to have improved.
Fabulous! This steel is of the{LF}highest quality!
This is not good. Take a look at{LF}how how much damage was caused{LF}when it was hit.
This steel was supposed to be{LF}an improvement over the last{LF}prototype.
I don't think this steel can be{LF}improved upon any further.
Well, thank you. With your help,{LF}I've been able to collect some{LF}valuable data.
Here's ＠数字９＠G for your services.
You got ＠数字９＠G!
This time, I'll also give you{LF}this ＠アイテム８＠ as a special{LF}present from me to you.
Here, please take this ＠アイテム８＠.
Hm, it looks like you don't have{LF}any space left in your backpack.
Make room for one more item in{LF}your backpack, then come back and{LF}talk to me again.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Good job. You've been a great help.
Is there anything wrong,{LF}Max? I'm looking around{LF}town for anything unusual.
You are? Thanks for your hard work.{LF}Right now, I'm not having any problems.
Not that anyone would dare mess with{LF}me, anyway.
Do you know about{LF}the spring ephemeral?
It's an early spring plant{LF}that lies dormant in the ground all {LF}winter, then blooms{LF}for a short time in spring.
I just love that flower, but{LF}unfortunately I've never seen one{LF}in this village.
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival.{LF}Of course I'll be going to it.
Gazing at the cherry blossoms{LF}in full bloom seems almost magical.{LF}Please be certain to go.
If you miss it, it's your loss!
That was quite a tremor yesterday.{LF}I wonder how long it's been {LF}since we had an earthquake.
Tomorrow is the{LF}Eating Contest {LF}that my father organized.
You've got to enter this one.
Are you going to participate, Max?
Who, me?　Don't be absurd.{LF}Do I look like I'd stuff my face{LF}for cheap amusement?
Swimming season starts tomorrow.{LF}I'll have the chance to show off my{LF}beautiful, sculpted physique.
I only have 14% body fat. Pretty{LF}amazing, huh? Well, I'm afraid I{LF}can't share my fitness secret, no{LF}matter how much you beg.{LF}
Tomorrow is the Monster Taming Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter?
I guess I'll go ahead{LF}and participate.
The walls in my room have lots of little{LF}cracks from that earthquake.
What a pain. Now we'll have to hire someone{LF}to repair it.
I don't mind the heat in summer,{LF}as long as I'm inside somewhere {LF}where it's cool.
Summer reminds me of traveling.
We used to travel every summer when{LF}I was little. I've been all over{LF}the world.
It's the Dance Festival tomorrow.{LF}
You'll need a partner for the dance,{LF}of course. Is there any particular{LF}lovely lady who you've got your{LF}eye on?
Tomorrow is the Fishing Contest.
I hope you have a good, sensible {LF}fishing pole, ＠カイル＠＠.
My father paid a ridiculous amount{LF}of money for a fancy, gilded fishing{LF}pole...
It's heavy, gaudy, and nearly {LF}impossible to use. You'd catch{LF}more fish with a mallet than you{LF}would with that thing!
For me, functionality is more{LF}important than beauty or looks.{LF}When it comes to tools, anyway.
A good, simple fishing pole is better{LF}than some gaudily ornamented{LF}pole any day.
If you want to be recognized as a {LF}proper adventurer, ＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you have to enter the Adventure{LF}Contest!
I hope you're planning to compete{LF}tomorrow.
The cracks in the wall from the last {LF}earthquake have gotten bigger.
I never fail to show my gratitude{LF}for the earth.
So I don't have any intention of{LF}slacking off during tomorrow's{LF}Harvest Festival.
I'll be there showing more gratitude{LF}than anyone in this village {LF}for the land's blessings.
The view of the fall foliage {LF}along the road is really something.
Oh, tomorrow is the Monster Contest.{LF}Are you going to enter, ＠カイル＠＠?
I was planning on participating, but{LF}I just haven't felt like myself lately.
I think I might drop out this time.
Tomorrow's Shooting Star Festival is{LF}a great opportunity to spend some time{LF}alone with someone you really like.
You have to take advantage of that!
Oh!　＠カイル＠＠,{LF}is that frostbite{LF}on your earlobes?
It gets really cold in the early morning, so{LF}you better bundle up well against the cold.
So tomorrow is the Mining Festival.{LF}Speaking of mining,{LF}have you ever struck platinum?
Platinum is very rare and precious {LF}as an ornamental material, but
I heard that it's also used for parts{LF}on musical instruments because{LF}it doesn't rust easily.
Lately, I'm really into music!{LF}So you can ask me anything about{LF}details regarding anything musical.
You must not be very interested.{LF}I imagine you're not, but{LF}you can just ignore me if you like.
There was another earthquake!
Actually, I've kept a record of the{LF}earthquake occurrences and their{LF}strength as far back{LF}as we've been having them, but
according to my notes, this recent {LF}series of tremors doesn't seem to be{LF}the result of any volcanic activity {LF}or tectonic plate strain.
Which leads me to believe that this{LF}earthquake must have been caused by{LF}something unnatural...
What could possibly have that kind{LF}of power?
The Sechs empire would be{LF}capable of doing something like that.
But, no. There's no advantage{LF}to doing something like that.
Hmm.
There certainly were many earthquakes{LF}this year.
A Seminar on Survival{LF}by Max de Sainte-Coquille:{LF}Part One.
The slogan for spring is...{LF}"master the staff!"{LF}Here we go!
You've probably noticed that staves{LF}aren't much good for physical attacks.{LF}Their real power lies in their ability{LF}to enhance the strength of your magic.
Magic spells let you attack your{LF}enemy from a safe distance and can{LF}come in handy in all sorts of{LF}situations.
You need RP to cast magic spells,{LF}though. Once you run out of RP, you{LF}won't be able to cast anything, even{LF}if you have plenty of HP left.
So you can't go around just casting{LF}spells recklessly!
If you want to train and develop your{LF}magic skills quickly, you'll need a{LF}way to replenish your RP!
So, what's the best source for {LF}replenishing your RP?
You know, don't you? That's right!{LF}A field full of growing crops!
Basically, if you want to master{LF}magic, you can't just spend your time{LF}in battles. It's also important to spend{LF}time cultivating your fields.
With the extra RP from your fields,{LF}you'll be able to practice your magic{LF}all day long. You'll be a master{LF}magician before you know it!
A Seminar on Survival{LF}by Max de Sainte-Coquille: {LF}Part Two.
The slogan for summer is...{LF}"master the hammer!"{LF}Here we go!
Battle hammers may be slow, but{LF}they're useful weapons because they{LF}have a very high chance of stunning{LF}an monsters.
When monsters are struck by a{LF}particularly powerful blow, they{LF}get stunned.
When a monster is stunned, you'll see{LF}stars above its head. While it's{LF}stunned, it won't be able to move{LF}or attack.
When you're faced with a group of{LF}enemies, try to stun one or two of{LF}them. This will make the group easier{LF}to deal with.
Remember, you can't just wade into{LF}a battle without a plan!
You have to have a good understanding{LF}of your weapons and their effects if{LF}you want to succeed!
So make sure you give the battle{LF}hammers a try. I'm sure you'll find{LF}that they're quite useful.
A Seminar on Survival{LF}by Max de Sainte-Coquille: {LF}The Final Lesson.
The slogan for autumn is...{LF}"master defense!"{LF}Here we go!
Shields are a handy defensive tool.
There isn't any trick to using a{LF}shield. Just equip one with a{LF}shortsword, and it will raise your{LF}defense.
That's not all there is to defense,{LF}though. Defense is also about{LF}strategy and planning.
Be careful when you're fighting{LF}groups of monsters.
Don't focus all of your attention on{LF}one monster and lose track of what{LF}the other monsters are doing.
If you do, you may get attacked from{LF}behind or surrounded.
If that happens, you're going to{LF}end up taking some serious damage.
Basically, always be aware of your{LF}enemies and surroundings. Draw the{LF}monsters to you and fight them on your{LF}terms, not theirs.
A good warrior uses brains as well{LF}as brawn to take control of the battle!{LF}Remember that!
Yo!　＠アルス＠＠!{LF}How're ya feeling?{LF}These cold winters can be tough, but{LF}I'm sure your youth and vitality {LF}will get you through.
Are you getting used to Alvarna?{LF}It's a nice, simple village, isn't it?
Alvarna is a nice, peaceful village, but{LF}at the same time it can be so ordinary{LF}that it's boring.
Night comes early in Alvarna.{LF}But, it is a country village after all.
That's what makes it so nice.
Do you know what I mean?
At my house, our family always {LF}gathers to eat meals.
I don't mind eating with my sister, but{LF}eating meals with my father {LF}can be uncomfortable.
I think you'd understand if you ever{LF}saw the way my father eats{LF}with your own eyes...
Listen to what happened {LF}at lunch yesterday...
My father acquired some utensils from{LF}the East called "chopsticks."{LF}We tried eating with them.
Frankly, they were quite difficult to use.{LF}But, they seem like they'd be more{LF}useful than a knife and fork, once{LF}you get used to them.
I wonder, though... {LF}Those chopstick things might{LF}catch on with a little publicity... 
This could be a great {LF}business opportunity!
Last night I broke our family tradition,{LF}and went out to eat by myself.
It made that gentle father of mine so {LF}angry. It was really a {LF}chore to calm him down.
I'm just sick of that kind of thing.
For some reason, I've{LF}been strangely captivated by{LF}＠アイテム９＠ since I was young.
Well, just a little background knowledge{LF}you should remember.
＠アイテム９＠ is so{LF}enchanting the way {LF}it's so fluffy.
I just love this.
Well, just a little background knowledge{LF}you should remember.
I don't like {LF}＠アイテム９＠ at all.
Well, just a little background knowledge{LF}you should remember.
Have you ever met Ray?{LF}He's Alicia's younger brother. {LF}You can usually find him at the clinic.
He and I are really close friends.{LF}Remember that.
Have you ever met Ray?{LF}He's the younger brother {LF}of Alicia the fortune-teller.
He and I get along real well.
Ray seems to be fond of{LF}my sister, Rosalind.{LF}
Hmm.{LF}Well...
Well, I'm just talking to myself, so{LF}you can just ignore me...
The kingdom of Norad is really a{LF}great place for a remote province.
No other empire is strong enough{LF}to invade Norad.
If anyone tries to attack us, we'll{LF}crush them like lowly insects!
Don't you agree? There is no kingdom{LF}so fine as Norad!
Norad is the place where man originated.{LF}That's really something, isn't it?
There's something that's really{LF}been fascinating me lately.
Can you guess what it is?
Music. It's music.
Just by performing music, you can {LF}see infinite possibilities.{LF}All of man's emotions. There are no {LF}limits to the breadth of expression.
It's truly a great part of our culture.{LF}Music is.
Have you ever heard of an instrument{LF}called the "piano"?{LF}I touched one of these "pianos" for the{LF}first time the other day...
The quality of the tones it can play{LF}was simply magnificent.{LF}I found it deeply entrancing.
As you already know, one day I will{LF}take over the de Sainte-Coquille{LF}family business.
When I take over the business,{LF}I plan to start up a music enterprise, and{LF}it will definitely {LF}be something to do with pianos.
I want to import those pianos and{LF}have others in this {LF}village learn about them.
I really like{LF}＠アイテム９＠ .
Why do you like that?
I can't say why out loud.{LF}If you want to know, lend me your ear.
Okay, go ahead.{LF}(I can't wait to hear)
*whisper*{LF}The reason I like it is... 
*whisper*{LF}a secret.

*whisper*{LF}a secret.
Compared to Rosalind and Cecilia{LF}I don't take much interest in fashion, but
judging from the way you look, {LF}you're in the same camp with me.{LF}Am I right?
Well, I spilled my soup at lunch{LF}and it made a stain{LF}on my shirt collar...
As you can see,{LF}it looks pretty sloppy.
For some strange reason, I don't care {LF}much about these things.
Rosalind seems to be fed{LF}up with me.
But fashion just changes{LF}all the time, doesn't it?
What's popular one year{LF}is obsolete the next.
So I'm not influenced by the latest {LF}trends. I just pick clothing that{LF}seems practical.
I like to call it "real clothing."
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I'll give you a piece of advice I overheard.
If there's someone you like,{LF}you should seek out chances to talk to {LF}her, whether day or night.
If you do, her{LF}good feelings towards{LF}you will quickly improve.
Alright!{LF}You've gotten some choice information.
I'll let you borrow that advice, but{LF}you have to pay me back 1 million times!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I'll give you a piece of advice I overheard.
If there's a girl in this village{LF}that you like, {LF}you should actively make use{LF}of the bulletin board.
There should be some concern or request{LF}from that girl among the postings there.
Check the postings frequently,{LF}and find a solution for them{LF}on your own.
If you do, before you know it,{LF}you'll have a romantic relationship{LF}started with the girl{LF}that you're interested in.
Alright!{LF}You've gotten some choice information.
I'll let you borrow that advice, but{LF}you have to pay me back 1 million times!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}I'll give you a piece of advice I overheard.
Do you usually do some mining?
They say that there are{LF}a lot of gems buried in this area that{LF}make girls fall for you.
If there's a girl you want to get to know,{LF}finding one of those gems is one method!
What do you think? Great information?
I'll let you borrow that advice, but{LF}you have to pay me back 1 million times!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I really hate{LF}＠アイテム９＠ .
They're so persistent! And they get{LF}everywhere! And they're so...so...{LF}ugly! Ugh. I find them deeply{LF}disturbing.

My birthday is the 6th of Autumn.
Listen, this is important!{LF}I'm going to test you on it later!{LF}So, remember it well!
My birthday is the 6th of Autumn.
Listen, this is important!{LF}This will be on the friendship test!{LF}So, remember it well!
My birthday is the 6th of Autumn.
Listen, this is important!{LF}This will be on the final test!{LF}So, remember it well!
Do you know what fortune-telling is?
Fortune-telling is the practice{LF}of using a combination of knowledge{LF}and intuition to predict a person's{LF}future.
Alicia also predicts the weather for{LF}the next day, and she's really {LF}good at it.
Alicia is quite good at some aspects{LF}of fortune-telling.
She can tell you where anyone{LF}in town is. She actually knows{LF}everyone's habits remarkably well.
As for her predictions about the{LF}future, though, you should take those{LF}with a grain of salt.
I hear she sometimes has to help{LF}her predictions come true...
I don't know why people care so{LF}much about predictions, anyway.
It all just seems like silly{LF}superstition to me.
The crops you produce have a {LF}reputation for being very delicious.
I hear the crops you produce have {LF}very few blemishes from pests.
Do you have some special pest{LF}repellant that you use?
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}there are high expectations{LF}for your produce. 
With your great contributions,{LF}the economic base of this village{LF}should really be firm.
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}if I don't have a cup of warm milk{LF}before going to bed,
I have a hard time getting to sleep.
It's one of my few{LF}weak points, I guess.
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}I actually have a habit of bouncing{LF}my leg.
Sometimes without being aware of it,{LF}I start bouncing my leg up and down.
It's one of my few{LF}weak points, I guess.
Don't tell anyone else, but{LF}I actually have a habit of biting{LF}on my pen.
Ray is always{LF}bringing it to my attention, but{LF}I haven't been able to stop it.
It's one of my few{LF}weak points, I guess.
My nickname in this{LF}village is "Mr. Perfect," but...
There's actually an animal that I hate.{LF}I can't say it loudly, but...
it's a bird called a partridge.
It has such a strange shape, it{LF}seems like it belongs in a different{LF}world. And the way it moves. Ugh....{LF}Just thinking about it makes me cringe.
My nickname in this{LF}village is "Mr. Perfect," but...
There's actually an animal that I hate.{LF}I can't say it loudly, but...
it's a bug called a "bed mite."
Ugh... Just saying the name makes{LF}my hair stand up.
My nickname in this{LF}village is "Mr. Perfect," but...
There's actually an animal that I hate.{LF}I can't say it loudly, but...
it's a bug called a horsefly.
Ugh... Just saying the name makes{LF}my hair stand up.
My dream is...{LF}to have a dream in my dream!
Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
When I was little,{LF}I really believed that when I grew up,{LF}I would become a rhino beetle!
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!
The cultivation of the land by {LF}farmers is the pillar of each town's {LF}economy all across our fair country.
But the future will be {LF}something else, I assure you.
It will be an era of large-scale farming{LF}using rune-powered farming {LF}machines. The production will {LF}be unlike anything we have today.
In order for us to be ready to accept{LF}this new age, when it finally comes,
we must now cast off our old, dusty{LF}customs and systems.
I am planning, under the auspices of{LF}the de Sainte-Coquille family, to one{LF}day create a financial institution for{LF}the farmers of Alvarna.
I will create a mechanical system of{LF}production with an effective, fast {LF}support and payment system.
When that happens, ＠カイル＠＠...
I would like to be able to call on you,{LF}too, to lend me your strength.
These last few days I have been waking{LF}up at 06:00:02 each morning.
It's most strange. I normally wake up{LF}on the nose of 06:00:00.
My anemia has been really bad recently.
I carry honey with me everywhere, and{LF}make sure to eat some after every meal.
My anemia has been really bad recently.
I'm eating as much liver as I can{LF}stomach.
I was raising a Toyherb, but it died...
The earthquake caused some nasty cracks {LF}in my walls. I filled them in and then {LF}painted over them, and I thought that {LF}was the end of it...
But now the paint is flaking off, and it {LF}only looks worse than it did before!
My trusty, dearest watering pot has{LF}started to leak...
I have to get it fixed, right away!
Have you ever thought about marriage,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Some say that marriage is the end of{LF}your life. 
But I think whether it turns out to {LF}be the end or just a new beginning {LF}depends entirely upon the people {LF}involved.
Have you ever thought about marriage,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
...Ah, hold it! There's something else{LF}I need to check with you first.
Is there a particular girl you would{LF}like to get closer to?
There is
No, not right now
I see! And would that be Rosalind?
H-How did you know that?!
I think you got bad information!
Heh heh heh, I knew it!
It's easy to see, from the way that you{LF}treat her.
I don't have any problem with you and{LF}Rosalind getting married.
In fact, I'd welcome just such a{LF}development!
You'd better watch yourself, though.{LF}My sister isn't one to let a man control {LF}her.
Well, I'll be supporting you. From the{LF}shadows, perhaps, but supporting you all {LF}the same.
Heh heh heh.
I see... just my mistake, then,{LF}I assure you.
I see, you've still got things you want{LF}to achieve alone. I understand!
That's us men, huh ＠カイル＠＠?
Sometimes I think about getting married, {LF}myself.
But... at the moment, at least, being{LF}alone just suits me better.
Once I have a wife... I'm afraid I'll{LF}simply devote all of my energies to her.
Do you have a friend, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}whom you can talk to, totally honestly?
Do you have a friend, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}whom you really feel that you could turn {LF}to in a pinch?
Are you a noble individual,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, with a heart strong{LF}enough to accept the weaknesses of {LF}others?
The Forest of Beginnings...
Apparently, it lies in a world{LF}parallel to this one.
The Forest of Beginnings...{LF}It's in a parallel world, yet{LF}interacts with our world.
What do you think the magic that{LF}connects these two worlds together is?{LF}Any ideas?
Sechs uses a device called a "Shift" to{LF}extract monsters from their {LF}home world... 
So maybe they understand the principles{LF}behind these things?
Although only the Sechs Empire would{LF}be foolish enough to mess about with{LF}a parallel world full of monsters...
The Forest of Beginnings...
Why do you think our ancestors chose to{LF}call it that?
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, what elements{LF}of our land do you feel are most vital {LF}for our future?
Consideration of nature
Creation of an army
That's right. The perfect answer,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Ignoring our natural environment and{LF}simply grabbing all that we can {LF}lay our hands on is just too short-{LF}sighted, isn't it!
We could end up killing all of{LF}nature like that.
And even the hardest-headed of people {LF}cannot believe that would leave us {LF}unaffected!
Because, in the truest sense of the{LF}word, we exist as one with nature... {LF}with the earth.
This town, and Norad too, does not have{LF}any need of military facilities!
I'll simply take that answer as a joke{LF}and leave it at that.
But let me give you a warning,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Depending upon the time and place,
you'd better bear in mind that some{LF}people certainly would not let a comment {LF}like that pass as a joke. Okay?
Tell me, ＠カイル＠＠, what elements{LF}of our land do you feel are not needed {LF}for our future?
Consideration of nature
Creation of an army
A good answer, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Indeed, the textbook answer. Perfect!
Hey now, that is hardly something for a{LF}farmer to say, is it?
I hope you are just kidding...
Remember that sometimes it is better to{LF}simply keep your mouth closed!
Let me indicate for you what you{LF}currently lack as a friend,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What you currently lack is...
Greed for money! 
!!!
Being incorruptible is all very well, {LF}that's true.
But I think you could be just a little{LF}more attached to the goal of making {LF}money, don't you?
I'm not telling you to become a{LF}penny-pinching miser, of course!
Money can make people happy, but it can{LF}also make them sad. That's why a {LF}certain... regard for it, shall we say, {LF}is necessary.
Money can be used for good, too,{LF}after all!
And I want you to be happy.
In lots of ways.
Do you believe that we are one and the{LF}same as the earth, a single organism?
I don't, I'm afraid.
All we do is exploit the earth,{LF}that's why.
No one gives anything back, do they?
When the runes run dry up, {LF}our civilization, everything we {LF}have achieved, will surely {LF}crumble into ruin.
But before that happens, the very earth{LF}itself may lash out against us...
What is that we should try to achieve{LF}in our lives?
Economic growth is important, of{LF}course, but that is only possible{LF}with the use of the land's resources.
We thrive when the land itself thrives.{LF}So, as important as money is, it's{LF}also important to take care of the{LF}land.
I know that it's surprising to hear{LF}me say something like that.{LF}
Those who can communicate with the earth are known as Earthmates. 
I have never met anyone who had the{LF}potential to become an Earthmate, not {LF}once.
At least, until I met you...
The Elder Dragons... I've heard the{LF}rumors, but do they really exist?
I think that maybe the legend of the{LF}Elder Dragons is a metaphor for some {LF}terrible disaster that occurred in the {LF}past.
It is also said that the Elder Dragons{LF}have the power to destroy all life{LF}in the world.
I wonder how people know that they{LF}have that power... Unless the Dragons{LF}caused some sort of terrible cataclysm{LF}long ago...
The Elder Dragons...{LF}And the Earthmates...
I can't help feeling that a mutual{LF}connection, perhaps opposition, lurks {LF}behind these two ancient terms.
Being a heroic figure who everyone{LF}looks up to gets quite tiring,{LF}doesn't it?
That's why I'm glad you're here,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You can understand what I'm talking{LF}about.
That makes you a good friend, and{LF}an even better rival!
Uh...thanks, Max!{LF}...I think.
What is life, after all, without a rival{LF}to test yourself against?
That's why I have great expectations for{LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠.
As a rival, and as a friend.
I'm really glad to have you around!
Uh...thanks, Max!{LF}...I think.
Ahhh...
What's up?
Nothing much. I'm merely relaxing.
What's that you're drinking?
It's a drink called a Hushabye. It's{LF}lactose- based, introduced to this{LF}continent by the de Sainte-Coquille{LF}family.
This drink is imported in a{LF}concentrated form.{LF}
Generally, though, it's not something{LF}that one wants to drink straight.
However, if you mix three parts {LF}concentrate with one part filtered{LF}water, it takes on a wonderful{LF}fragrance and has a fantastic taste.
This elegant taste instantly {LF}captivates all who taste it.
...
Say, ＠カイル＠＠...
Don't you think that our meeting could {LF}be compared to a wonderful chemical {LF}reaction, just like in the creation of {LF}the Hushabye?
Do you see further changes ahead for us{LF}too, perhaps?
You've really helped me to mature, Max.
And you I, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I can't help feeling that I've obtained{LF}something very special through my {LF}meeting with you.
I guess that is like the reaction{LF}in the Hushabye drink!
Quite right!
Now, take up a glass!
Let us toast our wonderful friendship!
Ah! ＠アルス＠＠!
Uncle Max! Hello!
Uncle Max! Hello!
Hey! ＠アルス＠＠!
I've told you, don't call me that! I'm{LF}more like... a brother to you, aren't I? {LF}Than an uncle?
Never call me uncle again, okay?{LF}Just call me Max!
But why?
But why?
Your mother is young and beautiful,{LF}isn't she, ＠アルス＠＠?
Of course! She's the most beautiful{LF}woman in the world!
Yeah. She's an angel, both young and{LF}beautiful!
And I'm her brother! I'm the same as {LF}her! Young and handsome!
Okay! I see now! Max!
Okay! I see now! Max!
That's better!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Be careful when you run around, or you{LF}may fall and hurt yourself!
Hey there, ＠アルス＠＠!
If you have any kind of problem... {LF}something that maybe you can't tell your {LF}other friends or even your mom...
Don't just suffer in silence. You can {LF}talk to me, okay?
I'll do anything for you, offspring of{LF}my dearest sister!
Hey there, ＠アルス＠＠.
Are you doing well? Ha! As if I{LF}have to ask!
Say, ＠アルス＠＠... {LF}The older you get, the more you look{LF}like your father.
Really?
Really?
Yeah.
That fiery mane of red hair is just{LF}like your dad's... 
...
Max...are you crying?
Max...are you crying?
Ah! It's not like me to shed tears{LF}now, is it?
Hah hah hah... don't tell your mom,{LF}okay?
Don't worry... cheer up, Max!
Don't worry, Max... {LF}Cheer up, for me, okay?
...
Hey there, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}It looks like you are enjoying school!
But you can't fool me, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You've been sneaking into the monster-{LF}infested forests and caves,{LF}haven't you?
What?! How do you know that?!
What?! How do you know that?!
You may be able to fool my{LF}sister, but you can't fool me!
So listen carefully, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You must never underestimate monsters.
If you sense the slightest hint of real{LF}danger, don't be afraid to turn around {LF}and run back to the safety of town.
The one thing I could never forgive you{LF}for is upsetting your mom!
Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
I understand!
Good! That's the way.
I hear you're growing tasty produce,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, just like your{LF}father did!
That's good! Very good!
How are you, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}How has your mom been recently?
Mom is fine! She's always smiling and{LF}happy!
Mom is fine! She is always smiling,{LF}like an angel!
That's good to hear. Make sure you{LF}always help your mom out,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I will! I'll protect her!
I will! I'll help her!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Shall I share a juicy secret with you?
What? What is it?!
Tell me! Tell me!
I'll whisper it to you, so come closer.
I'm here! Come on, tell me, quickly!
I'm here! Come on, tell me, quickly!
Okay! Here we go...
*whisper* My super juicy{LF}secret...
*whisper* ...is a secret!
I've found that thinking under{LF}the spring sun can be {LF}surprisingly effective.
There's no scientific basis for this,{LF}of course.
It's almost summer again, isn't{LF}it?
The season of harvest! What produce have{LF}you been growing, ＠アルス＠＠?
This room is actually fitted with air{LF}conditioning!
Hey there, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Do you like the entrance to this house?
It's the perfect place to play.
This room is filled with aroma of mint{LF}during this season.
I love to come in here and take a deep{LF}breath when I'm feeling frustrated or {LF}irritated.
It's so calming! Try it!
This room is filled with aroma of citrus {LF}during this season.
Isn't it a lovely, refreshing smell?
Because of the large windows we have,{LF}this room always has a lot of sunlight.{LF}It keeps the room warm, even in winter!
Something good may happen if you take a {LF}bath everyday. You never know, do you?
Taking a bath in summer almost seems{LF}pointless. I get sweaty again almost {LF}right away!
When I was small dirt bothered me so {LF}much that I would always have to take {LF}two baths before I felt clean!
No matter how hot your bath may be,{LF}make sure you always submerge {LF}so that the water covers your shoulders.
I played on this very street when I was{LF}young.
The west side of this street faces out{LF}onto the ocean.
But don't go jumping in there, just {LF}because it's hot outside!
Be careful, ＠アルス＠＠! Run around like{LF}that and you'll fall and hurt yourself!
If you have to go outside in winter,{LF}just make sure you don't catch a cold.
This harbor, as you might expect, is a{LF}gathering place for merchant ships from {LF}various countries.
The decorations and style of each ship{LF}strongly reflects the culture of each {LF}country.
It can be pretty interesting!
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}If you catch a fish let me have a taste,{LF}will you?
As I'm sure you can see, this harbor is{LF}very small.
A large number of ships can't put in{LF}here at the same time.
The wind from the ocean can sometimes{LF}blow really fierce here.
Wow, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}You must get your feisty, hot-blooded{LF}nature from your dad!
You've certainly been honing your{LF}skills, haven't you ＠アルス＠＠?
Hmmm. Lizards move around all{LF}over the place, don't they?
Did you know, ＠アルス＠＠, that{LF}creatures living in cold climates tend {LF}to have thicker layers of fat, making it {LF}harder to damage them in battle?
Sometimes, ＠アルス＠＠, you'll{LF}find it necessary to just accept and go {LF}with the flow rather than try to resist {LF}it.
Although I don't think I need to{LF}tell you that, do I?
You really know your stuff!
Hmph! That ＠カイル＠＠! Just where has{LF}he been all this time?!
That idiot... Making everyone worry{LF}about him!
I'm going to give him a piece of{LF}my mind later!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How's it going?
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠. How's it going?
Thank you for this. But I would have{LF}preferred it on my birthday...
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠, I'm so happy that{LF}you remembered my birthday!
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}But you've already done enough.
Leann, try drinking this!
Leann, try drinking this!
Can I drink this, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}It looks really good, I must say.
I'll give it a try, then...
...
Well? Was it good?
Well? Was it good?
Yes, it was delicious!{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
Just what is this, ＠アルス＠＠?
Don't worry about that,{LF}just knock it back!
Very well. I'll try it right away.
Well? Was it good?
Yes! I don't think I've ever had{LF}anything as delicious as this!
Thank you very much, ＠アルス＠＠.
Wow! ＠アイテム９＠!
Are you sure you want to give me this?{LF}I'm so happy!{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠! |
Oh, it's wonderful! I love it! |
Wow! ＠アイテム９＠!
Are you sure I can have this?{LF}I'm so happy!{LF}Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠! |
Oh, it's wonderful! I love it! |
Wow! ＠アイテム９＠!
Are you sure I can have this? I'm so{LF}happy! Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠! |{LF}Milk products are so good for you,{LF}aren't they?
Oh, it's wonderful! I love it! |
Ah... ＠アルス＠＠... {LF}This is ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}I...don't really like these... 
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
I can't give this.
Can I really...have this for free?
Just what's going on here...?{LF}Gordon...?
Don't worry about that!
Do you, Leann, take ＠アルス＠＠ to{LF}be your lawfully wedded husband,{LF}to love and to cherish, in sickness and {LF}in health...
...Until death do you part?
Ah... Well... 
What's wrong? You can't make the vow?{LF}I'm not good enough for you?
!!!
I do! I vow to love ＠アルス＠＠{LF}forever!
Do you, ＠アルス＠＠, take Leann{LF}to be your lawfully wedded wife,{LF}to love and to cherish, in sickness{LF}and in health?
Do you promise to love her until{LF}death do you part?
Of course!
Then I now pronounce you man and wife!{LF}You may kiss the bride!
What?!
...
Gah ha ha ha, I guess you can't quite{LF}manage that, eh, ＠アルス＠＠?
Tell me, ＠アルス＠＠, and you, Leann.
Do you two both understand the meaning {LF}of a kiss? Really understand?
A kiss is a holy, blessed thing,{LF}brought only to those who know{LF}true love.
You two are too young to know true{LF}love yet, I think.
Go out into the world, experience both{LF}joys and sorrows, and finally learn to {LF}accept the weakness of others... Only {LF}then you can know true love!
Until that time comes, I will hold{LF}onto the kiss for you both.
What? We have to let you keep it?
Until you lose that wide-eyed{LF}look, yes! Gah hah hah hah hah!
Yes... I do need to travel the world,{LF}and experience all that life has to{LF}offer! Wow, just thinking about it{LF}makes me excited!
You should do the same,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
I'll wait as long as it takes, until{LF}both of us have come to know and {LF}understand what Gordon meant!
There you have it! Got it,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Got it!
Good!
Very well! I'll send you two off with{LF}a hearty laugh!
Gah hah hah hah hah!
School during a holiday is totally{LF}different, isn't it? It's so quiet!
The desks and blackboards and everything {LF}else in this school are all here because {LF}of your father.
As a joke, someone drew a picture on{LF}the blackboard of me and Orland{LF}sitting in a tree.
I was so embarrassed, I rubbed it off{LF}right away!
I'm good friends with Orland, and I talk {LF}to him all the time, but I think maybe {LF}people have the wrong idea... 
Watch out if you are in the library,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
Roy and Cammy are the oldest in our{LF}class.
Not that I ever really think about it.
Just between us...
Leonel might be a boy, but I think a{LF}pleated skirt would really suit him.
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
Barrett may look scary, but he's so kind {LF}in his lessons. He really makes them{LF}easy to understand!
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
Mana makes difficult topics easy to{LF}understand, and will repeat herself as {LF}many times as she needs to until we {LF}get it.
Although something she repeats herself {LF}too many times, dragging things out...
For some reason, I always feel like {LF}finishing lessons early and just heading {LF}outside to play on Wednesdays.
Hello! Each starts with a friendly{LF}greeting!
I borrowed an eraser from either{LF}Sera or Serena...
But now I forgot which one of them it{LF}was!
Tee-hee!|
Use ingredients grown in your own{LF}fields to make the recipes you{LF}learned in school.
And then have everyone enjoy them{LF}with you!
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
It's my turn to clean the classroom{LF}after school today.
Both Sera and Serena napped during{LF}the lesson today.
I shook them and tried to wake them up, {LF}but they were sleeping too deeply!
If you see anyone eating their lunch{LF}during lessons, be sure to tell them to {LF}stop!
Even if Sera and Serena are apart, they{LF}can still feel and understand each{LF}other's feelings.
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
It's so cold today! I think my ears{LF}have got frostbite just from walking to {LF}school!
I got this pencil from my father.{LF}It makes you smarter, he said...
I wonder if that's true, though?
Sports are harder in winter,{LF}aren't they?
My athletic clothes aren't{LF}very warm!
Have you ever heard of the circular{LF}constant, ＠アルス＠＠? It's more{LF}commonly known as "pi."
Pi is the ratio of a circle's{LF}circumference to its diameter.
It can be applied to any form of{LF}circular shape, as it is a universal{LF}constant.
My father told me that he knows pi{LF}to 35 places!
Let me give it a try... 3.141592...{LF}Um... That's all I can remember!|
When you first learn something in school {LF}you may feel that its pointless, that it {LF}will never do you any good.
Indeed, at times the lessons{LF}themselves may feel like a chore, like {LF}you can't take any more.
But this... this learning is vital for {LF}our future! 
What is the future?
That is when, having finally come of{LF}age, we will arrive at a point in which {LF}we shall have to make a decision on our {LF}own, via our own determination.
Those who can greet such a future are{LF}what we call adults. 
So an adult is a person with the skills {LF}required to make decisions for {LF}themselves, and to take the {LF}responsibility for those decisions.
What is this skill, then?
What else but the foundation laid by our{LF}learning here at school.
Just as a house without supports cannot {LF}exist, an adult without a solid {LF}foundations cannot exist either.
Have solid foundations and be able to {LF}apply them... 
This may sound like the most natural,{LF}obvious of statements, but it is {LF}actually pretty hard to fully understand {LF}it.
That is what I have learned from {LF}studying here in school with you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠...
And Sera, Serena, Orland, Leann, Cammy {LF}and Roy.
I think we are very lucky,{LF}very happy children!
Your father built this school,{LF}didn't he, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}I want to thank him...
And indeed, thank you from the bottom of {LF}my heart! So... thank you!
Is pure friendship between a boy and{LF}girl truly possible?
I'm in no position to ask this question,{LF}however, because I don't know the answer {LF}myself!
Is pure friendship between a boy and{LF}girl truly possible?
I'm in no position to ask this question,{LF}however, because I don't know the answer {LF}myself!
Is pure friendship between a boy and{LF}girl truly possible?
I'm starting to think that maybe...{LF}maybe it is!
Is pure friendship between a boy and{LF}girl truly possible?
I'm sure that it is!
I put a picture book that I drew myself{LF}in among the books in the library.
But it's buried among so many books...{LF}I doubt anyone will ever find it.
A huge double bed is a little too much{LF}for me, I think. I'm still only a child!
If possible, I'd like to get it changed{LF}for a normal, child-sized bed...
The room on my right is now used by my{LF}mother. My aunt used it before, I think.
It has a really big mirror.{LF}I wish I had one of those in my room!
I wonder if I could ask her to move it{LF}in here...
My father gave me this treasure chest,{LF}depicting the countryside in the {LF}suburbs around the Empire. 
From the look of this picture, that {LF}country is not much different from here {LF}in Alvarna, rich and refreshing.
The hot spring symbol at the entrance to{LF}the baths...
Is based on the motif of a brimming{LF}bathtub.
Ever since he was a boy, my father {LF}has taken took two baths every day.
But I've gone one better. I take three{LF}baths a day!
Once after waking up, one after lunch,{LF}and one before going to bed.
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
In the east, I have heard, it is{LF}customary to drink while in the bath.
Winter is the best season for a nice,{LF}hot bath! |
I must admit, I find it...{LF}strange that the park shares my name.
The fountain looks so cool and{LF}refreshing! If I knew no one would see {LF}me I'd strip off and jump right in {LF}there!
My father told me that throwing a coin{LF}over arm toward the fountain will make {LF}your wish come true.
The water of this fountain is kept at a{LF}cool 50, apparently.
The proof, if you need any, is that even{LF}though the surrounding air temperature {LF}is below freezing the fountain water {LF}hasn't frozen over.
Why do you think the adults set it all{LF}up like this? I can't work it out, but I {LF}am only a child.
Still, I think... that it's really a{LF}wonderful thing!
Cammy loves to run up and down and all{LF}over the place until she gets totally {LF}covered in mud.
She really looks like she's having fun!
A small creature, called a beetle {LF}shrimp, has taken up residence in the {LF}fields in front of the school.
The leaves scattered outside the school{LF}would be perfect for wrapping potatoes {LF}for baking.
If you look up at the sky and open your {LF}mouth, you can catch snowflakes on your{LF}tongue!
They don't really taste like anything,{LF}but the gentle melting in your mouth{LF}feels quite wonderful...
I sometimes feel like I'm too old{LF}to catch snowflakes, but I just{LF}can't help it!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Hello!
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠!
Good evening!
The shooting stars are already shooting, {LF}aren't they?
Yeah!
They're wonderful. So beautiful!
Aren't they?
I'd like to take one of them home and{LF}hang it in my room!
That's a great idea! A lovely dream to{LF}have.
Thank you.
Okay then! I'm going to make your dream{LF}come true, Leann!
Really?
That's a promise!
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
You really mean so much to me!
I'd better be getting home, anyway.{LF}Mom will be starting to worry about me.
Okay.
One last thing, ＠アルス＠＠...
Yes?
You really do promise?
Of course! I'll make your dream come{LF}true, you can count on me!
Thank you!
Nice to meet you. I am{LF}Leann de Sainte-Coquille.
I hope we can be friends,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠. How are you?
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Happy new year, ＠アルス＠＠!
I hope the de Sainte-Coquille{LF}family will see a lot more of{LF}you this year!
The Flower Festival... I don't want to{LF}go alone. I'd much rather go with some {LF}friends.
Who will I invite, then?
How about me?
How about a friend of yours?
Okay!
Then I'll be waiting in{LF}＠マップ９＠.
Yes, that's what I'll do.{LF}Ask a good friend of mine.
The cherry blossoms are a beautiful,{LF}deep pink.
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
I'll be waiting in{LF}＠マップ９＠.
Let's do this together again next year, {LF}too!
The cherry blossoms that bloom {LF}in Alvarna look even more beautiful {LF}when hit by the rays of the spring sun.
The Flower Festival gives everyone {LF}a chance to see them in all {LF}their glory!
Please come and take part.
The Eating Contest. Why don't you{LF}give it a try, ＠アルス＠＠?
Congratulations on your victory!
I was... amazed by just how much you{LF}ate, ＠アルス＠＠! And how fast!
Just how did you make your jaws so {LF}strong?
Flowers really do soothe the heart and{LF}mind!
Losing in this contest, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}simply means you can only enjoy food in {LF}the way that it was intended to be {LF}enjoyed - eaten slowly and chewed well.
And I think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing!
Ah, it's the 1st day of summer {LF}today! The smell of the sea in{LF}summer... How invigorating it is!
Becoming friends with monsters...that{LF}might actually be a wonderful thing.
Though you could never afford to {LF}totally let your guard down, could you? {LF}Never forget that you are {LF}dealing with monsters...
Are you going to take part too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠? If so, please be sure{LF}to take care.
That was wonderful! Congratulations!
Can you introduce me to the monster that{LF}you made friends with?
That was a shame...
But at least you weren't injured!
My father has taught me to dance{LF}himself, so I am actually quote {LF}confident.
Dance with me
Maybe we'll dance together one day
I'll happily be your partner.
I'm sorry. I can't dance with you.{LF}There is a reason... but I can't tell{LF}you that, either.
The Dance Festival comes {LF}only once a year.
Am I the only one who thinks we could {LF}hold it a little more frequently?
Dancing in the park like this isn't{LF}something you can do every day.
Your lead is excellent, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're very good at this!
I feel like we've been transformed into{LF}the lead couple in a big musical {LF}production! |
I'm sorry, ＠アルス＠＠.
I think being close to someone special{LF}is just a wonderful thing, I really do.
I understand these things!
You must be planning on joining the{LF}Big Cook-Off, right ＠アルス＠＠?
My father said that cooking is all{LF}about love.
That no matter how cheap your{LF}ingredients may be, if prepared with{LF}love, they can taste as wonderful as{LF}the finest of produce... 
I'm sure your cooking is jam-packed{LF}with love, ＠アルス＠＠!
I wish I could have tried even just a{LF}mouthful!
Don't worry!
Oh dear! I entered and won!
I can't help feeling I should have at{LF}least given you a chance,{LF}＠アルス＠＠...
You are always going out on adventures,{LF}aren't you, ＠アルス＠＠?
If you take part in the Adventure{LF}Contest, ＠アルス＠＠, then no one{LF}else will stand a chance!
Brilliant, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Perfect!
Please, can you give the other{LF}participants a chance next year? I don't {LF}think anyone will take part otherwise!
Oh dear... ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}there was no need to hold back!
All we seem to do is take from the {LF}earth, receive its blessings.
So we have to give our full thanks{LF}today, don't we?
It's the Monster Contest today, isn't{LF}it? I don't really enjoy this one, I'm {LF}afraid...
Well... congratulations, anyway.
Well... that was a shame, anyway.
I asked my father about the stars.{LF}He whispered to me...
It's a secret!
That's all.
Let's go look at the stars together!
I hope I can stay up until it gets dark.
Yeah, let's go together!
Then I'll be waiting for you tonight at{LF}9 in ＠マップ９＠.
I'm sorry. I can't tonight, there's{LF}something I have to do.
Try some caffeine. I'm sure it will get{LF}the job done!
Then I'll be waiting for you tonight at{LF}9 in ＠マップ９＠.
Please, ask me again another time!
I love the glittering tails that{LF}shooting stars leave across the sky!
Don't you think they are just the most{LF}wonderful thing?
It's the Shooting Star Festival today,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
If's the Mining Contest today.{LF}Are you planning on taking part,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Congratulations on your win!
That was a shame...
I had a lot of fun this year... {LF}Mainly thanks to you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Let's continue to make Alvarna a fun,{LF}lively place next year too!
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠!
I saw the bulletin board. {LF}What do you want to talk{LF}about? I can lend you an ear{LF}if you'd like.
I saw the bulletin board. {LF}What do you want to talk{LF}about? I can lend you an ear{LF}if you'd like.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
I'd like to talk to you{LF}about a problem I'm having.
Okay. But what kind of problems {LF}could you possibly have, Leann?
Okay. But what kind of problems {LF}could you possibly have, Leann?
My sewing grades aren't really all that {LF}good...
Do you have any tips for how I could{LF}improve them, ＠アルス＠＠?
Wait... I thought your grades were{LF}some of the best in the class!
Wait... I thought your grades were{LF}some of the best in the class!
Well... Most of them are, but I'm having{LF}a lot of trouble with sewing...
I see... Well, that just makes me think{LF}this all the more...
I see... Well, that just makes me think{LF}this all the more...
You do study very hard, Leann, but{LF}sometimes I think you push yourself too {LF}hard.
You do study very hard, Leann, but{LF}sometimes I think you push yourself too {LF}hard.
...
I think you should relax, unwind a{LF}little, and not make yourself so{LF}tense when you sew.
I think you should relax, unwind a{LF}little, and not make yourself so{LF}tense when you sew.
Relax...?
That's right! I think you're so tense{LF}that it's carried over to your {LF}sewing.
That's right! I think you're so tense{LF}that it's carried over to your {LF}sewing.
Yes, you might be right.{LF}That could be it, ＠アルス＠＠.
It is, I'm sure.
It is, I'm sure.
Okay! I'll try relaxing the next{LF}time I sew!
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠! I'll be{LF}sure to follow your advice!
I'm glad I could help you!
I'm glad I could help you!
Please, then, take this as{LF}a thank you... 
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
Oh, okay!
See you later!
See you later!
(Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠...)
Leann slipped ＠数字９＠G into{LF}your pocket.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
Hello, ＠アルス＠＠!

I saw the bulletin board. {LF}What do you want to talk{LF}about? I can lend you an ear{LF}if you'd like.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠!
I'd like to talk to you{LF}about a problem I'm having.
What kind of problem?
What kind of problem?
Well, I've developed a bad habit{LF}recently...
I've been waking up in the middle{LF}of the night and snaking on junk{LF}food lately.
Well, you just need to stop the urge{LF}to have a midnight snack if you wake{LF}up at night.
Well, you just need to stop the urge{LF}to have a midnight snack if you wake{LF}up at night.
I know... Logically, I know, but that{LF}isn't enough to stop me...
What should I do, then?
Hmmmm, let me think...
Let's see...
Imagine yourself fat
No one will like you if you're fat!
Imagine myself overweight...?{LF}That might work, actually.
Imagine feeling out of breath after{LF}running just a short way, too! What {LF}would that be like?
Imagine feeling out of breath after{LF}running just a short way, too! What {LF}would that be like?
Oh, yes! That would be terrible!
Thinking like that will definitely help{LF}me to stop snacking!
Oh, yes! That would be terrible!
Thinking like that will definitely help{LF}me to stop snacking!
So? Do you think that will work?
Yes! I think it will, ＠アルス＠＠!
Great!
You're right... can I ask you something,{LF}then?
Of course.
Tell me, ＠アルス＠＠...{LF}How do you feel about slightly...{LF}plump girls?
What?
I can't say I've ever really given it{LF}any thought.
Really?
Yeah.
...I see.
Don't tell me you're worried about{LF}getting fat, Leann?
Yeah, I think I am... Just a little.
Ah ha ha! You're worrying too much!{LF}And even if you were plump, it{LF}wouldn't bother me at all anyway!
I like you too much for that, Leann!
Really?
Yes, really!
You promise?
I promise! Do you need me to prove it?
Prove it? How?!
Hmmm... I know!
Let's go to the chapel!
Wh-What?!
Come on, let's go!
Well? Is that going to help?
Yes! I think it will! Please, take this{LF}as thanks.
Don't worry! I don't need your money.
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠...
See you!
(Thank you...)
Leann slipped ＠数字９＠G into{LF}＠アルス＠＠'s pocket.
Thank you, ＠アルス＠＠.
Leann, do you know anything{LF}about something called thee{LF}＠アイテム９＠?
Leann, do you know anything{LF}about something called the{LF}＠アイテム９＠?
Of course! If a husband and wife{LF}drink spring water from it on their{LF}first anniversary, they are said to{LF}be granted eternal happiness!
Do you know where it is?
Do you know where it is?
My father bought it from someone quite{LF}a while ago. The former owners had {LF}fought over it, then made up... 
But then they had another big fight,{LF}and then they made up again... This{LF}went on, and on, and on...
It was an heirloom in their family,{LF}apparently, but, in the end, it{LF}caused so much friction that they{LF}decided to sell it.
That's how my father came to own it.
Wow, that thing kinda sounds like a{LF}lightning rod for trouble, but do{LF}you think I could borrow it?
Wow, that thing kinda sounds like a{LF}lightning rod for trouble, but do{LF}you think I could borrow it?
You can have it. I'm sure my father has{LF}forgotten all about it. It's in the {LF}dining hall, I think.
Thanks!
Thanks!
It should be in the dining hall.{LF}You can keep it if you find it.
You found the ＠アイテム９＠.{LF}Well done!
Does your nose get all itchy when spring{LF}comes around, ＠アルス＠＠?
That's a sign that you have an allergic{LF}inflammation known as hay fever. 
I've made a charm to ward off bad{LF}weather. We don't want it to rain for {LF}the Flower Festival tomorrow!
One of my oldest{LF}china plant pots broke {LF}in the earthquake... 
You're going to take part in tomorrow's{LF}Eating Contest, aren't you,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Swimming season starts tomorrow!
I'm so excited I don't think I'll be{LF}able to sleep tonight!
That reminds me... It's the Monster{LF}Taming Contest tomorrow, isn't it?
I'm good friends with Sera, Serena,{LF}and Orland too.
The three of them all have quite...{LF}unique personalities.
They can come up with the most{LF}unexpected things sometimes!
But such surprises are one of the {LF}reasons that I enjoy spending time with {LF}them.
Don't you think that's just the most {LF}wonderful thing?
Have you heard of gelato, ＠アルス＠＠?{LF}Do you know what it is?
It's kind of like ice cream, but{LF}supposedly much less fattening!
That's why it is all the rage with women {LF}at the moment.
It's the Dance Festival tomorrow.
I'm quite excited!
It's the Big Cook-Off tomorrow.
I know certainly people who always put{LF}on weight afterward!
It's the Adventure Contest tomorrow.{LF}Are you going to take part,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
They have military facilities in Norad,{LF}for the sake of national defense.
But other countries go as far as {LF}calling them tin soldiers due to {LF}their lack of effective leadership and {LF}poor training.
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival. Rather{LF}than spending a single day offering {LF}thanks to the land, however, I try to do {LF}so every day.
Here in Alvarna there are plenty of{LF}vegetables that can be harvested in {LF}fall. Eggplants and peppers may as well {LF}be on our national food!
That reminds me, it's the Monster{LF}Contest tomorrow, isn't it?
I'm afraid that's one competition that{LF}I just can't look favorably upon.
Aren't the stars romantic? I can't wait{LF}for the Shooting Star Festival tomorrow.
I've heard that if you do a somersault{LF}before a shooting star totally {LF}disappears from sight one of your {LF}wishes will come true.
If you follow it with a forward roll {LF}with your legs open then two of your {LF}wishes will come true! Why not try it?
I love to see the town of Alvarna{LF}covered in snow.
I can't say I have much interest in{LF}mining, really...
At lunch yesterday I tried to eat some {LF}salad with cutlery from the east, called {LF}chopsticks. 
I just couldn't pick anything up with{LF}them, though, and most of it ended up on {LF}the floor!
It provided plenty of entertainment for{LF}my mother and father, at least.
I don't like wasting food,{LF}but... it made for a change.
Tomorrow is the start of a new year.{LF}So much has happened this year, I don't {LF}know where to start when I think back {LF}over it all!
Hold on a moment...
Have you heard of ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}I really love it!
I've heard they have all sorts of{LF}＠アイテム９＠ in a town in Norad!
I'm quite jealous, I must admit.
Make sure you eat a good breakfast.
Although I guess I don't need to{LF}tell you that, do I, ＠アルス＠＠?
Have you heard of ＠アイテム９＠?{LF}I really can't stand them.
The town of Kardia has a legend{LF}concerning turnips, of all things...
A mysterious, beautiful young girl is{LF}said to have grown a giant turnip...
Like the eyes of a dead fish...
...
Ah, I'm sorry! I'm not brave enough to {LF}say any more than that...!
Alvarna is surrounded by mountains,{LF}and blessed by nature.
I wish I could just spend forever with{LF}you here, ＠アルス＠＠, in this{LF}wonderful place!
Well done, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Congratulations on defeating the giant, {LF}dangerous monster that made {LF}Trieste Forest its domain!
I'd love to hear the story of your{LF}battle, when you have time.
Well done, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Congratulations on defeating the giant,{LF}dangerous monster that made {LF}Blessia Island its domain!
I'd love to hear the story of your{LF}battle, when you have time.
Well done, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Congratulations on defeating the giant, {LF}dangerous monster that made {LF}Messhina Valley its domain!
I'd love to hear the story of your{LF}battle, when you have time.
Well done, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Congratulations on defeating the giant, {LF}dangerous monster that made {LF}Padova Mountains its domain!
I'd love to hear the story of your{LF}battle, when you have time.
Dragon Break... Where could it be?
In order to uncover the truth, I {LF}worked up a profile on Barrett, whom I {LF}believe is somehow involved with the {LF}weapon.
This has led me to the conclusion that{LF}he hid it in a library or similar {LF}location.
Of course, the school doesn't even have{LF}a library at the moment... 
Dragon Break... Where could it be?
If my previous profile was correct then{LF}it should be somewhere in the library.
You're so dependable, ＠アルス＠＠!
I heard that your dad came back.{LF}That's great news, ＠アルス＠＠!
I'm so happy for you...
What's up, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Can I help you out?
Say, Yue, will you take a look at this{LF}ore for me?
This... this is... Boy! Where did you{LF}get this?! This is super rare!
I found it with Julia. But I don't{LF}really have anything I can use it for... 
To start with, we were hoping to use it{LF}to draw new customers to Julia's store, {LF}but that didn't really work out... 
But I thought maybe you would have an{LF}idea of how to use it, Yue.
Oh, it sounds like you and Julia are {LF}getting up to all sorts of adventures, {LF}eh, ＠カイル＠＠?
I-It's nothing like that!{LF}Julia just asked me for her help!
There's no need to protest so much!{LF}You're at that age, after all!
Ah ha ha! Anyway... {LF}Do you have any idea how to use this?
Let me see...
How about making it into a ring?
I'm sure Julia would love to see it{LF}transformed into a charming accessory.
Girls love to receive gifts like that!{LF}You know, jewelry and stuff!
Not to mention that it will be made {LF}from something that will remind her{LF}of your exciting, secret excursion{LF}together! It's perfect!
Secret excursion?{LF}It was nothing like that!
But a ring is a good idea.{LF}I think Julia would really like it! 
Isn't it? | Now that that's decided, {LF}just leave everything to me!
I know a really skilled craftsmen.
We've had a long working relationship.
Normally, getting him to create a ring {LF}would cost quite a lot of money... 
But this time I'll use my connections to {LF}make it super cheap!
A ring like this would normally cost{LF}around 30000G.
But how does ＠数字９＠G sound?
Perfect!
Still a little too much.
Great! Come back in three days and it{LF}will be ready.
Thank you!
Oh? I thought that was a pretty good{LF}offer. Well, come back any time. You can {LF}totally trust me with things like this!
The ＠アイテム９＠ was returned to you.
You don't have enough money! Even for{LF}this super deal! Come back when you've {LF}saved up some cash!
A ＠アイテム９＠ was returned to you.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}A girl has to work hard to maintain{LF}her beauty! |
I knew I could count on you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! Thank you so much!{LF}Here's your reward!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Plant these seeds and grow them into{LF}big radishes!{LF}Big radishes are the best!
Do come again!
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, it looks like you've got your hands {LF}full! Make some space for me, okay?
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Yue, here's the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}that you asked for.
You got it, ＠カイル＠＠!
This is just what I asked for!{LF}Perfect!
Great work, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}If you keep this up, I'll have to{LF}take you on a date!
Hee hee.{LF}I'm gonna strike it rich{LF}with this one!|
Ah, there's the matter of your{LF}payment, of course.
Here you go! Good work!|
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I made this ＠アイテム８＠ myself!{LF}I hope you like it!
See you later, ＠カイル＠＠.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, it looks like you've got your hands {LF}full! Make some space for me, okay?
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Yue, here's your ＠アイテム９＠.
Thank you! You've really helped me out,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! |
Well then... let's give it a try!
First, boil the grass... Then wring{LF}the juice out... Then gently rub it onto {LF}the cloth... 
*rub rub*... *rub rub*... *rub rub*...
Ah! Look! The stain came right out!
Fantastic! My kimono looks as {LF}good as new again!
It's all thanks to you, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Here's a little something to show{LF}my appreciation!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you. I'm glad it worked.
Me too!| It's important to look{LF}professional at work! Nobody is going{LF}to trust a merchant with a gross,{LF}stained kimono.
I really owe you one, ＠カイル＠＠! |
Ah, it looks like you've got your hands {LF}full! Make some space for me, okay?
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Yue, here's the ＠アイテム９＠{LF}you wanted.
Thanks so much!{LF}Brilliant, ＠カイル＠＠! |
Finally, a ＠アイテム９＠!
Now I can safely cross the{LF}Phantom Sand Dunes!
I can really count on you, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Thanks for helping me out! |
Asking you for help is definitely the{LF}way to go!
Here's a little thank you!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Here's something else for you, too.
You got 100 pieces of wood!
I'm sure you can find a use for all{LF}that!
I hope I can count on you in the future,{LF}too!
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, it looks like you've got your hands {LF}full! Make some space for me, okay?
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, you caught one.
I don't mind eating fish...but I'm{LF}just no good at catching them!
You've really helped me out,{LF}＠カイル＠＠! |
Here you go, then!{LF}A little "thank you" from me!
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
I made this myself. Give it a try!
Thank you.
Heh heh heh. I'm sure I'll be calling{LF}on you again!
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, it looks like you've got your hands {LF}full! Make some space for me, okay?
Is that really for me? I can't say I've{LF}ever really wanted one of those...
Yue, I've brought the grass you wanted.
A ＠アイテム９＠! Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!
I still need:
＠アイテム８＠.
＠アイテム７＠.
Okay?
Do your best, ＠カイル＠＠!
That's everything you asked for,{LF}right?
Yep! Great job!{LF}I'd expect no less from you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Great! That's more than enough!{LF}Now I can dye the fabric perfectly.
Great. Good luck with your new kimono!
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll certainly do my best!
You really helped me out. 
You got ＠数字９＠G!
If I need help again, I'll know where{LF}to turn, ＠カイル＠＠! |
It was no problem.
Is that really for me? I can't say I've{LF}ever really wanted one of those...

Yue, I found it. This is what you{LF}lost, right?
Yes! This is it!{LF}Well done, ＠カイル＠＠!
I knew I could trust you to find this!{LF}You really are trustworthy, aren't you?
Phew... I'm glad I got it back...
You've done so much for me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, haven't you?
Thank you! | Here's something to show{LF}you my gratitude! |
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
Thank you, Yue. This is great.
Just a token of my affection!
Keep it safe!
I will.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
You're here to use the {LF}＠アイテム９＠, are you?{LF}Go on then, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you want?
Hmm...
Actually, I changed my mind.
I want to exchange it for you, Yue.
Ah well! If you want anything just{LF}come and find me!
I'll be waiting!
...
Um, ＠カイル＠＠, does that mean{LF}you're...pro-pro-pro...
Proposing. Yes, Yue, I am.
What I want, Yue, more than anything you{LF}have on sale...is you.
Please, Yue, will you be my wife?
Oh...this is all like a dream!{LF}Of course! I accept!
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I know we'll be happy together!
Um, ＠カイル＠＠, does that mean{LF}you're...pro-pro-pro...
Proposing. Yes, Yue, I am.
I'm... not quite ready for marriage yet,{LF}I think... Can you give me some more {LF}time?
The ＠アイテム９＠ was{LF}returned to you.
This is past its use-by date. I wish{LF}you'd given it to me a bit sooner!
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Oh, isn't that one of Gordon's pendants?
You brought it here for me? Thanks!
Gordon's pendants are really popular{LF}in other towns!
He's got great taste! He oughta{LF}become a craftsman full-time!{LF}He's that good!
Anyway, thanks, ＠アルス＠＠! Thank{LF}Gordon for me too, will you?
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Ah, is that the COLD MEDICINE I asked{LF}Dorothy for? You brought it for me?
Yeah. She asked me to give it to you.
Yeah. She asked me to give it to you.
Great! Thanks a lot!
Thank Dorothy for me too, would you?
Yeah, no problem!
Yeah, no problem!
Is that really for me? Thanks! I can{LF}certainly put that to good use.
Is that for me? Thanks! |{LF}I really love these! |
You can't have my ＠アイテム８＠!
Is that for me? Thanks! |
Oh, that sparkle!{LF}I just can't resist it! |
Oh... you don't have to give me that{LF}much!
I don't like slimy things... Don't like{LF}them at all! Ugh, they make me feel {LF}sick!
I certainly don't need all this!
Is that for me? Thanks! |{LF}I really love these! |

Yue, please drink this.
What is it?
Oh... my heart's all a flutter!{LF}Please... don't stare at me so intently!
Yue, please drink this.
What is it?
You always help me out so much,{LF} ＠カイル＠＠! I'm totally grateful{LF}for everything!
Here, you can have this.
Here, you can have this.
What is it?
When I see you working so hard,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, it makes me want to{LF}do the same!
Oh, it looks delicious! Is that really{LF}for me? This would taste even better if {LF}it was my birthday!
Oh, it looks delicious! Is that really{LF}for me? This would taste even better if {LF}it was my birthday!
That looks delicious! Actually, it's my{LF}birthday today. But I never thought I'd {LF}get a present like this... Wow! I'm so {LF}happy!
That looks delicious! Actually, it's my{LF}birthday today. But I never thought I'd {LF}get a present like this... Wow! I'm so {LF}happy!

All those blooming flowers sure make {LF}spring a lovely season!
Wearing this getup in summer makes life{LF}pretty tough. But image is everything!
Fall is a mysterious season, isn't it?{LF}Even produce available the rest of year {LF}still tastes better!
Everything is covered with snow. Watch {LF}your footing or you could take a nasty {LF}fall!

I want to talk to you.
I want to buy something.
I don't need anything.
Come again!
Welcome! Made your fortune yet?
Welcome! I'm not about to lose out to{LF}this heat!
Welcome! You see the falling leaves and{LF}expect some falling prices, huh,{LF}＠カイル＠＠? I think you'll find{LF}I charge a fair price all year-round! |
Welcome! I'm not about to lose out to{LF}this cold!
I want to talk to you
I want to buy something
I don't need anything
Oh, really? Do come again, then!
Selling things outside is the perfect{LF}profession for spring time.
Summer is a pretty hot season to be{LF}selling stuff outside, I must admit.
There's so much good food in fall.{LF}I always overspend!
Selling things outside during winter{LF}is no picnic. Believe me.

The sea in Alvarna really is beautiful,{LF}isn't it?
Summer is the time to hit the beach and{LF}swim in the ocean, but I don't have a {LF}bathing suit with me!
That breeze feels good! I hope it stirs{LF}up some customers, too!
The snow and the sea really go{LF}beautifully together, don't they?
I want to talk to you
I want to buy something
I don't need anything
Oh, really? Do come again, then!
The cherry blossoms are so beautiful.
I hate all the bugs in summer. {LF}Getting one trapped in the folds of{LF}this outfit can lead to some real{LF}trouble!
At last, a cooler, more manageable{LF}season.
The snow falls really thick here,{LF}doesn't it?
Just leave everything around the house {LF}to me!
Just leave everything around the house {LF}to me!
Just leave everything around the house {LF}to me!

Hello, darling!|
Now that we're married, I've decided{LF}to call you darling! Is that okay with{LF}you, darling one?
Yeah, I like it.
Oh! I'm still a bit embarrassed by all{LF}this!
But I'm so happy to have married you,{LF}darling! |
I'm so happy that you love me, darling!{LF}I love you too!
I hope we have a baby soon! |
Home is the place to relax after a long{LF}day's work!
I've visited lots of different towns,{LF}and seen lots of different things, but {LF}meeting you is the best thing to ever {LF}happen to me, darling!
I hope you feel the same way!
I haven't been feeling all that well{LF}recently... I think I have heartburn or {LF}something... 
Are you okay?{LF}I hope it isn't anything serious...
No, I'm fine, I'm sure...
Let's make lots of lovely memories{LF}together, darling! |
Work hard at building the school,{LF}darling! It's for ＠アルス＠＠'s future,{LF}too.
Large-scale projects are best discussed {LF}with Mayor Byron. Talk to him when{LF}he's in his office on the first floor{LF}of his house.
Do you want a son or daughter? |
I'm sure everyone would be overjoyed if{LF}you can build a school.
I hope the school is finished soon,{LF}darling!
I've got something very important to {LF}tell you, darling...
What?
I... I think we're going to have a{LF}baby!
R-Really?!{LF}That's great!{LF}I'm so happy for us, Yue.
Me too!{LF}I can't believe it...{LF}
We're really having a baby...{LF}I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl?
Which would you rather have, darling?
A boy
A girl
Either
I hope it's a boy.{LF}How about you, Yue?
I hope it's a girl.{LF}How about you, Yue?
I'll be happy either way.{LF}How about you, Yue?
Yeah, me too!
So...our family is going to be{LF}getting a little bigger.
We'll have to try to be good parents.
Of course!
Darling,{LF}I think our baby's coming soon.
Our baby is here!
Really? I'm so proud of you, Yue!{LF}Is it...?
It's a boy!{LF}See, he looks just like you.
It's a girl!{LF}See, she looks just like you.
Well would you look at that?{LF}You're right!
We need to decide on a name.{LF}Do you have any ideas?
＠アルス＠＠.{LF}That's a fine name.{LF}I like it.
I'm glad.
Hello ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You'd better eat a lot{LF}and grow up strong and healthy!
Growing up...
Did you say something, dear?
Yes.{LF}We're going to need a school.
A school...{LF}Yeah, that would be nice.{LF}
Now that our little ＠アルス＠＠{LF}is starting to grow up, I think{LF}it's time for me to talk to Byron{LF}about building us a school.
That sounds like a good idea.{LF}Good luck, darling...{LF}For ＠アルス＠＠'s sake.
I won't let you two down!
I want to talk.
I want to buy something.
Never mind.
Oh really?{LF}Well, feel free to come by any time.
Monsters never come out here,{LF}but this is as far as I go.{LF}It's too scary to go inside.
Aren't you going to buy something?
It always feels like springtime{LF}in this forest, even though it's{LF}the middle of fall back in town.
If I get cold in the winter,{LF}I can always run back here to warm up.
I want to talk.
I want to buy something.
Never mind.
Oh really?{LF}Well, feel free to come by any time.
It feels good to be out on the beach,{LF}don't you think? I just hate how sand{LF}always manages to get inside my kimono.
This island would be paradise if{LF}it weren't for the monsters.{LF}It seems like such a waste.
I wonder if there's anything{LF}deep in the middle of the island.{LF}I wish I could see for myself, {LF}but I'm too scared of the monsters.
I wish this island were{LF}a little easier to get to.
I want to talk.
I want to buy something.
Never mind.
Oh really?{LF}Well, feel free to come by any time.
Isn't the air so clear out here?{LF}It's because we're surrounded by nature.

Oh really?{LF}Well, feel free to come by any time.
The dungeon is just ahead, but hardly{LF}anyone ever goes inside there.{LF}If you're going there, you should buy {LF}something from my shop to take with you.
It's quiet outside of the town.

It's quiet outside of the town.
Were you waiting here long?
No, don't worry about it.{LF}I'm glad you came,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Let's go somewhere where{LF}it's easier to see.
I'm looking forward to seeing{LF}the shooting stars.
Me too.{LF}I wonder how many we'll be able to see.
I hope we get to see a lot of them!
Oh! Look, there's one already!{LF}It's beautiful...
Yeah... Beautiful... 
I lost myself there for a moment.{LF}I wonder if we'll see another {LF}shooting star? I'll have to remember{LF}to make a wish next time.
May I have g--{LF}
Oh, it's already gone...
Ha ha ha, they disappear too fast!{LF}Maybe you should try a shorter wish.
I can say it fast enough!
Watch, I'll get it this time!
May I have good busine--urk!
Ouch, I think I just bit my own tongue.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine...{LF}But I don't think I'll{LF}be trying that again.
Still, I'm glad I got{LF}to watch the stars with you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Me too, Yue.
Ha ha ha,{LF}I'm happy to hear you say that.
It's starting to get chilly.{LF}We should head back before we{LF}end up catching a cold.
Shall we go?
Thanks for tonight, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I had a great time with you.
I won't forget it, Yue.{LF}Thanks.
Goodnight, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}See you later!
Hey, who are you? I haven't seen{LF}you around here!
Oh, I'm ＠カイル＠＠.
The name's Yue! I'm a traveling{LF}merchant!
I've got plenty of rare{LF}items at reasonable prices,{LF}so come by anytime you want!
All right. I'll have to{LF}take a look sometime.
I know the prices seem too low, but I{LF}promise I'm not losing any money{LF}on it. Just pretend you've tricked{LF}me, and buy everything you want.
Uh... O-Okay...
Good morning.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, good morning.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.
Good morning, ＠カイル＠＠.
Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.

Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.
How are you?
Good evening, ＠アルス＠＠.
Happy New Year,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I'm going to make so {LF}much money this year!
Ha ha, that's the spirit, Yue.{LF}I should learn to be as {LF}optimistic as you are.
You have to start the New Year{LF}with the right attitude. Come on,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, how about{LF}being my first customer this year?
Well, hurry up and buy something!
Ha ha ha...{LF}(It looks like she's going to{LF}be even more pushy this year...)
Happy New Year,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Today's the Flower Festival.
I like looking at the flowers{LF}when they are this pretty.
What am I thinking?{LF}I don't have time for this!{LF}I should be out selling food{LF}for the festival!
Ha ha ha.{LF}You never quit, do you?{LF}By the way, Yue...
Will you go flower watching with me?
What else do you sell for the festival?
Today's the Flower Festival.
Yue, would you like to go{LF}look at the flowers with me?
You're asking me?{LF}Yeah, that sounds nice.{LF}Let's go!
I think the cherry tree at the{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}is the prettiest to look at.
Why don't we meet over at the{LF}＠マップ９＠?
I'm not interested if you've{LF}already asked someone else,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Well, I've got plenty of party {LF}favors for sale too!{LF}
Why, do you want to buy any?
It's a beautiful time of year.
Go on ahead to the{LF}＠マップ９＠.
I need to get ready first.
I had fun, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Ask me out again sometime, alright?
Today's the Flower Festival.{LF}The cherry tree is beautiful, isn't it?
Today's the Eating Contest.{LF}If you're going to enter,{LF}I'll cheer you on!
I haven't decided yet.{LF}I guess I don't see any reason not to.
See if you can make it exciting,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Wow, you did great,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I didn't expect that out of you!
That was awful,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Keep up like that and they{LF}won't let you back in the next one!
Today's the Eating Contest.{LF}If you're going to enter,{LF}I'll cheer you on!
Wow, you did great!{LF}I didn't know you had it in you.
That was awful,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}Keep up like that and they{LF}won't let you back in the next one!
Swimming season starts today.{LF}I'm actually an outstanding swimmer.{LF}I just need to remember where I put{LF}my swimsuit.
Yeah, I guess you can't swim{LF}wearing those clothes, can you?
I'd have to be crazy to{LF}try swimming like this.{LF}I'd probably drown!
Swimming season starts today.{LF}It's fun to go swimming, but{LF}just be careful out there.
Today's the Monster Taming{LF}Contest. Whether they're{LF}trained or not, it sounds {LF}dangerous to me.
Yeah, even if you're used to {LF}working with monsters, you can't{LF}ever let your guard down.
I don't think I'd ever be able{LF}to get along with monsters.
I have a lot of respect{LF}for people that can train{LF}monsters. I really do.
You did really well, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I had no idea you were so good with{LF}monsters!
Ah... Ha ha ha! I guess I got lucky.
You don't need to be so humble about it.{LF}A win is a win, and you won.
That didn't go very well, did it?{LF}Well, don't let it get you down.
Today's the Monster Taming{LF}Contest. Whether they're{LF}trained or not, it sounds {LF}dangerous to me.
I don't think I could ever get along{LF}with monsters. I have a lot of respect{LF}for people that can train monsters.{LF}I really do.
You did really well!{LF}I never thought that you'd win.
That didn't go very well, did it?{LF}Well, don't let it get you down.
Today is the Dance Festival.{LF}I doubt anyone's going to bother{LF}asking me out, but I can't help{LF}being a little nervous anyway.
Yue, would you like to dance with me?
Umm, never mind.
Who, me? Really? Are you sure,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Or are you just joking?{LF}If you really mean it, I'd love to.
I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It's awfully nice of you to ask me out,{LF}but I just can't.
Oh...okay.{LF}Well, I'll talk to you later then.
I had fun today, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I didn't think anyone would bother{LF}asking me out.
You made me very happy.{LF}Ask me out again sometime, alright?
I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It was nice of you to ask me out.
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You look like you're having fun.
Today's the Dance Festival.{LF}Who are you going to ask out,{LF}＠アルス＠＠?
Today's the Fishing Contest.{LF}This town's fish are famous for{LF}being especially delicious!
You did it!{LF}You should feel proud that you{LF}caught such a large fish.
I thought you'd do better than that...
Today's the Big Cook-Off.{LF}The food where I'm from has{LF}its own special character.{LF}You should try it sometime.
You did it!{LF}You should be proud. {LF}Not everyone can be a good cook.
If you're not that good of a chef,{LF}why'd you bother entering the{LF}contest in the first place?
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}This one sounds like it was made just{LF}for you, ＠カイル＠＠.
It sounds too dangerous for me,{LF}though!
When you're traveling from town to town,{LF}don't you have to deal with monsters{LF}sometimes? What do you do?
I'm always so scared that I just{LF}sprint away as fast as I can.{LF}There's no way I could handle dealing{LF}with them in the Adventure Contest.
(I'd think she'd have a good chance{LF}at winning this competition, but...)
I knew you could do it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}You're really something. I'm amazed!
I bet you'd be a good bodyguard for me{LF}next time I have to go on a trip.
That didn't go very well, did it?{LF}Well, sometimes you just have an{LF}off day and there's nothing you{LF}can really do about it.
Today's the Adventure Contest.{LF}Just leave me out of it! It sounds too{LF}dangerous for me.
You did great, even though{LF}you're still just a kid!{LF}You must take after your father.
That didn't go very well, did it?{LF}Well, sometimes you just have an{LF}off day, and there's nothing you{LF}can really do about it.
Today's the Harvest Festival.
Your vegetables always taste{LF}so delicious, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Thank you for sharing them with me.
O-Oh, thank you.{LF}I enjoy growing them.
Well, I have to give my{LF}thanks to the earth,{LF}and thanks to you also, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Today's the Harvest Festival.{LF}I wouldn't be able to be{LF}a merchant if it weren't for{LF}the blessings of the land.
Today's the Monster Contest.{LF}I wonder what monsters are going to{LF}make an appearance this time?
I have a lot of fun at this competition.
Aren't you scared of the monsters,{LF}Yue?
No, I feel more thankful{LF}for them than anything.{LF}Their claws and hides can sell{LF}for a lot of money, you know.
I see...
You did it, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I wasn't expecting that.
That was tough to watch.{LF}That competition wasn't{LF}anything but luck!{LF}Keep your chin up.
Today's the Monster Contest.{LF}I wonder what monsters are going to{LF}make an appearance this time?
That was great!{LF}I wasn't expecting that.

Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I like stargazing.
Will you go stargazing with me?
Umm, never mind.
What? With me?{LF}Really?
Umm, ＠カイル＠＠... {LF}
I'll be waiting for you at the{LF}＠マップ９＠{LF}at 9:00 tonight.{LF}You'd better be there!
I'm glad that you invited me, but...{LF}I can't go with you.{LF}I'm sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.
What? Don't you have anything to say?
I wish it would hurry up{LF}and be 9:00 already.{LF}I want to watch the shooting stars.
Meet me at the{LF}＠マップ９＠ at 9.
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It was sweet of you to ask me out.
That was a lot of fun!{LF}I never would've even dreamed{LF}that you'd invite me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I bet I could sell a shooting{LF}star for a lot of money, but{LF}none of them seem to be landing{LF}here...
Today's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}I bet a shooting star would sell{LF}for a lot of money!
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}If you're going to enter the contest,{LF}be careful in there.
I'm used to going inside the{LF}dungeons by now. I'll be fine.
A little confidence is good,{LF}but don't let your guard down...
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you really did it, didn't you?{LF}Did you find any rare minerals?
If you did, I might be able to {LF}sell it for a lot of money...
It looks like you didn't try very hard.{LF}You're not going to dig up anything{LF}without putting some effort into it,{LF}you know.
You didn't even dig up anything{LF}special, and you still won...
Today's the Mining Contest.{LF}I know it's a contest, but you{LF}shouldn't be hanging around the{LF}dungeons. They're dangerous!
You did it!{LF}Did you find any rare minerals?
It looks like you didn't try very hard.{LF}You're not going to dig up anything{LF}without putting some effort into it,{LF}you know.
It's the last day of the year.{LF}I've had a very interesting year.
Next year, all I want is good health{LF}and good business.
That sounds like something you'd say,{LF}Yue. Me, I just hope I can get plenty{LF}of work done in my field.
Let's hope we both have{LF}another good year.
It's the last day of the year.{LF}I've had a very interesting year.

If it's helpful to you,{LF}I'll be happy.
If it's helpful to you,{LF}I'll be happy.
If it's helpful to you,{LF}I'll be happy.
Thanks!{LF}When I need something else,{LF}I'll be sure to ask.
I can make a lot of money off of this.{LF}Thanks!
I've got to take good care of this{LF}kimono. It's my favorite one!
I knew you'd do it, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm glad I could count on you.
Thank you so much.{LF}I won't rest until I've found{LF}a way to pay you back.
This fish looks so delicious!
I think it's time for me to start{LF}work on my original kimono!
I think I can do good business with{LF}this.
I owe you another one.{LF}I'm embarrassed even to talk about it.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I think I'm really falling for you.
You'll have to wait a little longer{LF}for the ring.
Here, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I've brought you what I promised.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
Thank you, Yue!
It's beautiful!{LF}I feel like I could get{LF}lost staring into it.
It is, isn't it?
You're really something,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
You know what this ring really looks{LF}like? An engagement ring!
Well, good luck, ＠カイル＠＠!{LF}I'll be cheering you on.
Ha ha ha.{LF}Don't make fun of me.
But thanks, Yue.
You don't need to thank me.{LF}Good luck!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I'm glad you came!
I thought I'd give you{LF}a gift today!
Here, take it!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
I just happened upon it the other day.{LF}Can you use it for your studies?
I don't really have any use for it{LF}myself, so I thought I'd give it to you.
Hope it's helpful to you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much right now! Clear out{LF}some space in your backpack!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I'm glad you came!
I found another ＠アイテム９＠,{LF}just like the one I gave you{LF}before.
I figured you might want this one,{LF}too.
Here, take it!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
If I find any more, I'll let you know!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much right now! Clear out{LF}some space in your backpack!
Oh, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}I'm glad you came!
I found another one of those pages,{LF}and I thought you should have it!
Here, take it!
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
There are a lot of these floating{LF}around, aren't there?
Have they been helpful to you?
I hope they have! That's the only{LF}important thing to me!
Oh, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much right now! Clear out{LF}some space in your backpack!
Yue, I saw your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
Thanks for coming, ＠カイル＠＠.
I have a job for you...
I have to do a lot of traveling in my{LF}line of work. That means I'm always{LF}climbing mountains and crossing rivers,{LF}you know, that sort of thing.
It's a rough lifestyle, to be honest,{LF}and it puts a lot of stress on my skin.
Of course, I try to take good care of{LF}my skin, but I can only do so much.
I see...
That's why I want{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
I've heard that if you eat{LF}＠アイテム９＠ every day,{LF}it helps protect your skin.
That's where you come in,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I want you to bring me{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You should be able to find it{LF}in Trieste Forest.
Okay, I'll go find it for you.
Thanks.{LF}Good luck, ＠カイル＠＠.
You're supposed to bring me{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
You should be able to find it{LF}in Trieste Forest.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Yue, is there something you need?
Hi, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I've been waiting for you.
It's about my request on the{LF}bulletin board.
I want a ＠アイテム９＠.
People in the next town over{LF}are paying a ridiculous price{LF}for them!
Well, I want to get in on that{LF}action!
Yeah, you can't let a good{LF}opportunity pass you by.
Of course not!{LF}If you're not willing to take advantage{LF}of a good business opportunity,{LF}you'll never make it as a merchant.
Now, as to where you can find{LF}that particular item...
I've heard that you{LF}can get them from{LF}the ＠モンスター９＠{LF}on Blessia Island.{LF}
＠モンスター９＠s are nocturnal,{LF}so they only show up after dark.
I'm sure that won't be a problem for{LF}you, ＠カイル＠＠.
I'll be waiting for you!
You can get a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}from the ＠モンスター９＠s{LF}on Blessia Island.
＠モンスター９＠s are nocturnal,{LF}so they only show up after dark.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
Yue, I read your note on the message{LF}board. Did something happen?
Take a look at this.
This stain... I was eating breakfast, {LF}and I guess I wasn't paying very good {LF}attention, because I got this stain on {LF}my kimono. Now it won't come out at all.
I've heard that {LF}＠アイテム９＠ juice can be used to{LF}remove stains, but I don't have{LF}any on hand right now...
I can't focus on my business when I've{LF}got such an awful stain on my kimono.
Could you bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠?{LF}You've got to help me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
Alright, I'll find one for you.
Really?{LF}Thank you!
I think you should be able to {LF}find a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}growing somewhere in the Padova{LF}Mountains.
It can be really dangerous in there,{LF}so be careful!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!
I need a ＠アイテム９＠{LF}to get this stain out of my kimono.{LF}I'm counting on you, ＠カイル＠＠.
They sometimes grow in{LF}the Padova Mountains.
It can be really dangerous in there,{LF}so be careful!
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}did you read my note on the message{LF}board? I need your help.
It's about the "Phantom Sand Dunes"{LF}I mentioned in my request.
The Phantom Sand Dunes are{LF}very dangerous to cross.
I've heard that they're made out of{LF}countless tiny fragments of glass.{LF}That's what makes them so blinding.
That sounds...strange.
They really exist?
They do.{LF}I was surprised the first time{LF}I heard about them too.
Each piece of glass{LF}reflects with each other.
All of those reflections make it{LF}impossible to see what's around you.{LF}Is the road over there? Is that someone{LF}else? Is there anything there at all?
No one who's entered the sand dunes{LF}has ever been seen again. Once inside,{LF}there's no way to tell where the path is {LF}or which way you've been walking.
Anyone who enters the {LF}Phantom Sand Dunes will become {LF}hopelessly lost... Doomed to {LF}wander the desert until... 
That's awful.
Yeah, it's scary, isn't it?
But... There's a stone called the{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Anyone who uses that stone{LF}can block the reflections in the{LF}sand and find a route across.{LF}
I want you to bring me a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
As for where you can get it...
Well, I think you should be able to{LF}find one in Messhina Valley.{LF}Try looking around where you usually{LF}mine.
Anyway, I hope it won't be too hard{LF}to find. Good luck!
Alright, I'll bring you back a{LF}＠アイテム９＠.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Be careful out there.
You should be able to find a{LF}＠アイテム９＠{LF}if look around Messhina Valley.
Good luck.
＠カイル＠＠, are you here{LF}about my request on the bulletin board?
Just to be safe,{LF}I need you to promise to keep {LF}every word I say a complete secret.
I-I won't tell anyone.
Lately, I've been doing a lot of{LF}business in a large town called{LF}Greenlake.
Every time I go there for business,{LF}this nobleman comes up to me.
Cesar is his name. You see, he's{LF}gotten really...attached to me.
And by "attached," I mean, uhh...
He flirts with me shamelessly. I mean,{LF}he flirts with a lot of girls, but{LF}he seems to pay special attention{LF}to me.
Of course, I'm not interested at all.{LF}He's just a spoiled, wealthy playboy.{LF}He wouldn't know an honest day's work{LF}if it bit him on the nose!
But he just can't seem to take a hint.
I thought that if I told him I had{LF}a boyfriend, he'd leave me alone.
But when I told him, he looked {LF}me right in the eyes and said, "Then{LF}prove it, my darling flower." 
There's such a thing as being too{LF}persistent, you know!
But if I can give him{LF}some kind of proof, maybe{LF}he'll finally leave me alone.
It might be my only chance{LF}to get him to understand.
Of course, I don't really have{LF}a boyfriend, but all I need to do{LF}is make it look like I do.
I'll bet an engagement ring would{LF}work!
I need a big, fancy engagement ring{LF}to show that I'm engaged to someone{LF}wealthy and powerful. That might{LF}be enough to scare Cesar off.
But that'll be really expensive.
That's the point, though. If I buy{LF}a cheap ring, Cesar will know that I{LF}bought it just to throw him off.
That's where I need your help,{LF}＠カイル＠＠. I need you to help me{LF}raise the money I need to buy an{LF}engagement ring.
I need ＠数字８＠G...{LF}Do you think you can help me?
Please?
Give her ＠数字８＠G.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Thank you!{LF}You're the best, ＠カイル＠＠!
You're such a good person!
As for your reward...{LF}You'll have to make do with this!
*kiss*
!!!
Thank you!
Um... Wow!
It's all I can afford right now.{LF}But it does come straight from my{LF}heart!
You got: A kiss on the cheek!
I appreciate the thought,{LF}but you don't have enough money,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
I'm sure you really wanted to help me{LF}out, but...
What?{LF}So you're telling me that you don't{LF}care that some sleazy womanizer won't{LF}leave me alone? 
You jerk!
Ha ha ha...
Yue, I saw your request{LF}on the bulletin board.
I've been waiting, ＠カイル＠＠.
Sorry to ask you so suddenly,{LF}but I want you to catch me a fish.
The fish around this town{LF}have a reputation for being delicious.
People in other towns can't seem{LF}to get enough of them.
So, ＠カイル＠＠,
I want you to catch a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me.
You should be able to fish for{LF}them on Blessia Island.
Be careful out there.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!
I want you to catch a{LF}＠アイテム９＠ for me.
You should be able to fish for{LF}them on Blessia Island.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠!
Did you want something, Yue?
I've been waiting, ＠カイル＠＠!
I just realized that I haven't{LF}been selling anything with{LF}any sort of originality.
I think I'd have better luck{LF}selling things if I had some{LF}original goods for sale.
Yeah, it would be nice if{LF}you had a signature item.
I know, wouldn't it?{LF}So I was thinking about making{LF}something all my own.
But it has to be special.{LF}If I make an original item, it will{LF}have to be the face of my business.
And it's no good if it doesn't fit in{LF}with the rest of your store, right?{LF}
And I've been thinking about what{LF}sets my business apart from the rest.
And then I thought about how much{LF}I love wearing my kimono.
I think I'm getting the picture...
So, ＠カイル＠＠,
I'm going to make my own{LF}original kimono!
That's a good idea.
Really?{LF}You really think so too,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?{LF}
There are special dyes I need{LF}in order to make it the right color.
I don't want to use anything artificial.
If I use natural dyes, it'll really{LF}show in my kimono's color and feel.
The one I'm wearing right{LF}now uses natural dyes too.
You're picky about your kimono,{LF}aren't you?
Sure am!
I want you to bring me several{LF}different kinds of grasses.
All I need to do is bring you{LF}a bunch of grass?
Yep!
First, since I'm just starting out,
I need{LF}＠アイテム９＠,{LF}＠アイテム８＠, and{LF}＠アイテム７＠.
Can you start out with those?
I'm sure you can find them on{LF}Blessia Island.
Alright.{LF}Just leave it to me.
I knew you'd do it, ＠カイル＠＠.
Good luck, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I need them to make my own {LF}original kimono!
I need{LF}＠アイテム９＠,{LF}＠アイテム８＠, and{LF}＠アイテム７＠.
Can you get them for me?
I'm sure you can find them on{LF}Blessia Island.
Good luck, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I need them to make my own {LF}original kimono!
Did you need something, Yue?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I've been waiting for you.
Do you remember how I've been {LF}working on making my own kimono?
Yeah, I remember.{LF}I helped you collect some{LF}colored grass for it.
Thanks to your help,{LF}I was able to try out a{LF}lot of different colors,
and I've finally completed{LF}my trial run!
Congratulations, Yue.
Here, it's this one!{LF}What do you think?
Wow... It-It's amazing!
Don't hold back! Give me all{LF}your thoughts on it.
If you have any comments or{LF}suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
Hmmm...
Well, um, I don't really know much{LF}about clothes...so I couldn't really{LF}say if there's anything wrong with it...
Sorry, I'm not really much of a help.
Oh well.{LF}At least you're honest with me.
Oh! That's right!{LF}There is someone who knows{LF}a lot about fashion.
Oh! Are you talking about Julia?
Yes, I'm sure she'd be able to come{LF}up with plenty of good advice for you.
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.{LF}She'll know better than anybody.
Today's such a lovely day!{LF}Hmm-mmmm-mmm!|
Julia, do you have a moment?
Hmm?{LF}Oh, hi there, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What is it?
I have a small favor to ask of you.
That's not like you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}What do you need?
Well, I was wondering if you'd look at{LF}a kimono that Yue just finished making.
I don't really know a lot about{LF}clothing, myself...
But I'm sure you'd be able to give her{LF}some good advice.
I'd be glad to!{LF}So she made a kimono... {LF}Let's see it!
See, Yue, she's going to help.
Thank you, Julia!
Where is it, where is it?
Hmmm....
Ohhh!
Really...
Oh, and here...
Wh-What do you think, Julia?
It's cute! And it's got{LF}such a pretty color to it!{LF}I love the short length, too.
I want one for myself!{LF}You did a really nice job.
Really?{LF}Thanks, Julia!
I've always been fascinated by kimonos!
It's really cute, isn't it?{LF}Now I feel like trying on one too!
Really?{LF}I'm glad you like it.{LF}Would you like to buy it?
I'll even give you a special discount.
Really?{LF}How much would it be?
For you, I could cut the price from{LF}50,000G all the way down to 30,000G.
Th-That's expensive... 
Kimonos aren't cheap, are they?{LF}Well, maybe later, after{LF}I've saved up some more money... 
Really?{LF}I think it's a good price...
Y-You do?{LF}I had no idea kimonos were so...{LF}serious.
Well, next time, then.
Yeah, next time.
Well, I need to get back to work...
Bye!
Thanks, Julia.{LF}You really boosted my confidence.
I'm glad I could help!
Julia really liked your kimono.{LF}And if she says she likes it,{LF}you know it has to be good.
I feel a lot better now.{LF}Now I can sell a lot of these!
Thank you too, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}It was your idea to talk to Julia.
Why didn't I think of making{LF}my own products earlier?{LF}I'm going to make so much money!
I hope you can sell a lot of them.
If I do, I'll have to do something {LF}to thank you and Julia.
But until then, this will have{LF}to hold you over.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You're always such a big help.{LF}I'll let you know if I need anything{LF}else.
Oh, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much right now.
Here, take this.
You got: ＠アイテム８＠!
You're always such a big help.{LF}I'll let you know if I need anything{LF}else.
Did you need something, Yue?
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you're finally here.
I just wanted you to know{LF}how thankful I am for how{LF}nice you've been to me,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Oh, it's nothing.
I mean it.
And I thought I'd show how{LF}grateful I am by giving you{LF}a really big present!
For me? You didn't need to...{LF}Thank you, Yue.
Well, uhh...that's the thing.{LF}There's a little problem with your{LF}present.
There is? What's wrong?
I lost it somewhere on Blessia{LF}Island. And after all the trouble {LF}I went to just to get it for you...
Ha ha ha...
Something came up. I didn't want to{LF}go to the island at all, but I didn't{LF}have a choice... And on the way home,{LF}I must have dropped it.
I can't believe I did that.
I want to go back and find it,
but there are just too many monsters{LF}on Blessia Island for me to go searching{LF}around in it.
There's no way I could find it myself.
I know this is a strange request,{LF}but could you check Blessia Island{LF}for me to find your present?
You're the only one I can count on{LF}to find it, ＠カイル＠＠.
Ha ha ha...
Well, I wouldn't want your{LF}present to go to waste.
I'll find it for you!
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.
I knew I could count on you.
I must have dropped your present{LF}somewhere on Blessia Island.
I know it's a stupid request,{LF}but please, find it for me.
Did you need something, Yue?
Ah, oh, hello, ＠カイル＠＠.
What is it?
Umm...{LF}No, it's nothing. Never mind!
...
Actually...there's something{LF}I wanted to talk to you about,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What is it?
Well, um.. I...{LF}I want you to take me on a...
d-d-d{LF}d-d-d-d-d-d{LF}d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-
date!
There, I said it.
Look at me. I'm so embarrassed.{LF}My heart's pounding,{LF}and my face feels like it's burning up.
I like you, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I have from the moment I met you.
I thought I'd try to let you know{LF}through my notes on the town's message {LF}board.
But I haven't been able to tell if{LF}you've gotten the message or not.
So...so...this time...I want you{LF}to go on a date with me!
Sure! Let's go on a date.
Really?{LF}You will?
Will you come see me tomorrow?
I will. I'm looking forward to it.
Me too!{LF}You'd better show up, ＠カイル＠＠!
Come see me tomorrow.
I mean it, ＠カイル＠＠!
＠カイル＠＠, you kept your promise.{LF}I'm glad you really came!
Today, it's going to be just the{LF}two of us!
Since this is a special date,{LF}I thought we might go to another {LF}town so we could have a change of{LF}scenery.
But then I realized that just getting{LF}there would take half the day, so we'd{LF}have to turn around and head back as{LF}soon as we got there.
So why don't we just stay right here{LF}and talk?
That's fine with me.
Good. Do you want to tell me all{LF}about your secrets, ＠カイル＠＠?
Secrets?{LF}I don't really have any secrets...{LF}I still don't remember much of my past.
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.{LF}Well, you at least know what{LF}things you like, don't you?
Yeah, I can remember that much.
Alright, let me ask you{LF}some questions, then!
What kind of food do you like,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Hmmm... I'd have to say...
Lighter foods.
Richer foods.
Strange foods.
You like lighter foods?{LF}I'm the same way.
Yeah, I prefer food that's{LF}a little easier on my body.
It's probably because you grow{LF}so many vegetables yourself.
Really, you like rich foods?{LF}I can't eat much of that myself.
I need heavier foods to give me the{LF}energy to work through the whole day.
Really?{LF}I just get heartburn...
Well, there's that too.
What, really?{LF}You're strange, ＠カイル＠＠.
No, you know, it's like when you first{LF}take a bite, maybe it tastes pretty {LF}bad, but soon you just find yourself{LF}wanting more?
No, I don't know what that's like.
Oh...
Alright, next question.{LF}What kind of music do you like?
Hmm....
Slow music.
Fast music.
Chanting monks.
You like slow songs?{LF}I think it shows in your personality.
It does?{LF}I listen to slower music to help calm{LF}myself down sometimes.{LF}It helps put me in a better mood.
Yeah, I guess I can see that.
I like faster songs myself,{LF}but relaxing music can be good too.
Me too!{LF}I like songs with a lot of energy.{LF}They really make me feel like dancing!
When I'm listening to a fast song,{LF}I feel like,
"Yeah! Let's go!"
It's like I could take{LF}on the whole world.
Yeah, I get the same feeling.{LF}I feel like I'm ready for whatever{LF}the day might throw at me.
Yeah, you said it!
Uh...chanting monks?{LF}That's not really what I meant{LF}when I said "music"... 
You can't be serious! Of course it's{LF}music -- and fine music at that. When{LF}I listen to it, I feel like I'm getting {LF}closer to discovering a great truth.
You're really serious?
Of course I am!
Ah, well, alright then... 
Next question!
What kind of clothes do you like?
I don't know a lot about fashion, but...
Comfortable clothing.
Stylish clothing.
Underwear.
I don't know a lot about style, so{LF}I'd just have to say I like normal,{LF}everyday clothing that's comfortable {LF}and easy to wear.
Really?{LF}Well, I guess you spend all day working{LF}out in your field, so that makes sense.
I like kimonos, even if they aren't{LF}always totally practical.
It always feels good when you're{LF}wearing something that you like to wear.
Yeah, it does.
I'd have to say stylish clothing{LF}is the best. If I feel good about{LF}the way I look, it's easier for me{LF}to really put my heart into my work.
I completely agree with you.{LF}When I'm wearing something I like to{LF}wear, I feel like I'm a completely{LF}different person.
It's a little hard to move around{LF}in this kimono, but I couldn't do{LF}my job without it.
I didn't know we had so much in common,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
What, you like to walk around like that?{LF}I don't believe you...
You don't believe me?{LF}Don't you think it's comfortable?
I didn't say anything about that!{LF}Come on, everyone would stare at you.
Yeah, but it's comfortable...
That's not my point...
Well, next question!
You read sometimes, don't you?{LF}What kind of books do you like?
Books, huh...?
Dramatic Books.
Adventure Novels.
Children's Books.
I like books that make me cry.{LF}After I finish reading them,{LF}I feel like my emotions{LF}are completely refreshed.
I feel the same way.
I usually end up bawling, though.
Next time, I'll bring you one{LF}of my favorites.{LF}It'll leave you curled up on the floor.
Oh, thanks!{LF}That sounds like my kind of book.
I like to read tales of adventures!{LF}I'm always turning the pages just{LF}to find out what happens next.
Sounds kind of childish to me.{LF}That's really what you like to read?
Hey, if you'd give them a chance,{LF}I bet you'd like them too.{LF}It's always exciting to see how{LF}the hero manages to escape trouble.
Well, that does sound interesting.{LF}I'll give it a try.
Children's Books?{LF}Aren't you a little old for that?
It's fun to look at the pictures.{LF}There's always so much to see... {LF}Flowers...animals...bugs... 
I could read those books all day long.
I don't see the appeal...
Want me to lend you one?
...{LF}I think I'll pass.
Okay...
Now for my last question!
Tell me something you don't like.
Hmm... Let me think...
Hurting others.
Selfish people.
Vegetables.
If I end up hurting someone, it feels{LF}even worse than getting hurt myself.
There's a part of me that doesn't even{LF}want to fight with monsters.
I always feel bad when I defeat them.
＠カイル＠＠... {LF}You're a nice guy.{LF}I...I'm touched.
I don't like selfish people.{LF}There's no excusing someone{LF}who never thinks about{LF}how other people feel.
Yeah, I feel the same way.{LF}I don't think there are any selfish{LF}people that are really worth anything.
You're a nice guy, ＠カイル＠＠.
But don't you grow vegetables yourself?
How do you manage to work with{LF}vegetables all day?{LF}I guess I'm...impressed.
To tell you the truth... I hate it.
I think that's the most shocking{LF}thing you've told me yet!
Ha ha ha...
...
How long have we been talking?{LF}I feel like I've learned a lot{LF}about you.
Don't you think we're fairly alike?{LF}I feel like we are.
I had a lot of fun.
I had fun too, Yue.{LF}I'm glad we had the chance to talk.
Me too!{LF}We should go on another date sometime!
How long have we been talking?{LF}I feel like I've learned a lot{LF}about you.
You're quite a bit different than I{LF}thought you were, ＠カイル＠＠.
I think I like it.{LF}Ha ha ha!
I had a good time talking with you,{LF}Yue.
Really? Me too.
I want to know more about you.
Well, we'll just have to go on{LF}another date then!
How long have we been talking?{LF}I feel like I've learned a lot{LF}about you.
I don't know what to say...{LF}There's a lot I just don't{LF}understand about you...
But I guess that's just the{LF}way you are, ＠カイル＠＠.
I think I have even more questions{LF}now than I did before.{LF}Ha ha ha.
I had a lot of fun today.
Me too.{LF}I'm glad we had a chance to talk.
We should go on another date sometime!
Oh, I almost forgot!{LF}I have a present for you.
This is a coupon for my shop.{LF}I'm giving it to you, ＠カイル＠＠.
You can exchange it for{LF}anything that I sell.
I've never given one to anybody else.{LF}Think of it as a token of my love for{LF}you.
You got: ＠アイテム９＠!
I don't know what to say, Yue.{LF}You've given me so much...
Please, take it.{LF}I'm just happy to be with you.
I always want to see you.{LF}I'll be waiting for you to come back!
Thanks for today.
Oh, it looks like you're carrying{LF}too much right now.
I like the springtime.{LF}The sakura blossoms are so beautiful.
Oh, maybe you've never heard of{LF}sakura trees. They bloom with{LF}pretty pink flowers.
Now that I think about it,{LF}they're a lot like the cherry trees{LF}around here.
Tomorrow's the Flower Festival.{LF}The Flower Festival is like a big{LF}party. I'm sure everyone will be{LF}making a huge fuss over it.
Ha ha ha,{LF}I bet Gordon and Natalie will{LF}be drinking all afternoon.
Yeah, I don't doubt it.{LF}But I like festivals too.
What was that earthquake?{LF}You know how much I have to carry {LF}around? Well, everything spilled out {LF}onto the ground. All of it. What a mess!
Are you alright?{LF}You weren't hurt, were you?
I'm fine.{LF}I guess we just have to put up with{LF}an earthquake every once in a while.
Tomorrow's the Eating Contest.{LF}Don't choke on anything!{LF}
It's the 1st day of summer tomorrow.{LF}I'm completely sold out of{LF}swimsuits already.
Tomorrow's the Monster Taming{LF}Contest. Sorry, but I don't{LF}sell anything that would help for that.
Ha ha ha, well I guess that's{LF}because you don't really need{LF}any items for the competition.
Really?{LF}You should see all the armor{LF}I was planning on wearing tomorrow.
We had another earthquake.{LF}Are you alright? All of my merchandise {LF}got scattered all over the place. It's{LF}a huge mess.
It sounds like you had a hard time, Yue.
These earthquakes are happening a lot{LF}these days.{LF}What's with that?
It's too darn hot out.{LF}It's tough to walk in the heat{LF}carrying all these heavy things.
I don't know how you can do it.
Well, I'm glad that you understand.{LF}When you think about how tough it all{LF}must be for me, doesn't that make you {LF}want to buy something from my store?
I know you're a nice guy, {LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm sure you couldn't bear leaving me{LF}without buying something now.
Ha ha ha!{LF}(How can I dig myself{LF}out of this mess...?)
Tomorrow's the Dance Festival.{LF}I don't dance much, {LF}but I still have a good time.
I don't think I'm very good{LF}at dancing either, but I'm{LF}looking forward to it.
I wonder what you dance like...
Tomorrow's the Fishing Contest.{LF}Are you good at fishing,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Well, I don't know if I'd call{LF}myself an expert or anything.
Oh.{LF}Well, it probably comes mostly down to{LF}luck, anyway. You should give it a try.
Tomorrow's the Adventure Contest.{LF}It's dangerous! You should make{LF}sure you're stocked up on items{LF}from my shop to keep you safe!
You're a good saleswoman as always,{LF}Yue. If I need anything, I'll buy{LF}it from you.
Another earthquake!{LF}Of course, all of my merchandise{LF}got scattered around again!
These earthquakes are hard on you,{LF}aren't they?
Very hard!{LF}I feel like I'm cursed or something...
Tomorrow's the Harvest Festival.{LF}Aren't you always harvesting one thing{LF}or another, ＠カイル＠＠?
Yes, I am.
So if we're all getting together{LF}to give thanks for the harvest,{LF}shouldn't we be thanking you, too?
Well, I guess. If you put it that way...
I want someone to be thankful for{LF}me some time. Why can't we have{LF}a Merchant Festival?
It's fall already. I like the colors{LF}of this season, but it always makes{LF}me feel a little sad.
Well, fall is a time of good harvest.{LF}Just be careful not to pick any{LF}poisonous mushrooms, alright?
Ha ha ha ha. How'd you know?
One time, I accidentally picked{LF}a laughing mushroom. When I went{LF}to eat it, I got a big surprise.
Tomorrow's the Monster Contest.{LF}Do you have a monster that{LF}you're ready to show off?
Don't be too hard on it, alright?{LF}Monsters are living creatures too.
You're right, Yue. Monsters shouldn't{LF}be used and exploited.{LF}We have to have compassion for them,{LF}too.
Wow, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How thoughtful of you.
Actually, I was just worried that{LF}you might damage their hide or claws,{LF}making them harder for me to sell.
Hey, don't try to sell my monsters!
Tomorrow's the Shooting Star Festival.{LF}Falling stars shine so brilliantly{LF}and then fade in an instant...{LF}That's why they're romantic.
Are you going to make a wish?
Yes, for good business, of course!
To be honest, if my wish doesn't{LF}come true, I'll be in trouble... 
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you know... If you wanted to,{LF}you could help my wish come true...
Ha ha ha! I get it, I get it.
It's too cold out.{LF}It's getting hard for me{LF}to do business outside.
I bet it's tough being{LF}out in the cold all day!
I'm like the little matchstick girl.{LF}Please, mister, won't you buy something?{LF}Won't you, ＠カイル＠＠?
Tomorrow's the Mining Contest.{LF}You might dig up something really rare!{LF}If you do, I'll buy it from you.
Ha ha ha!{LF}You must be looking forward to tomorrow.
You bet I am!{LF}It's a chance for me to get my{LF}hands on all the ore I can carry. 
There's no way I could dig up{LF}that much on my own.{LF}I'm too delicate!
(I don't know... I'd say she has{LF}to be pretty strong to carry all{LF}that weight around every day.)
Another earthquake...{LF}I think I'm going to have to close{LF}up shop for the day. All my merchandise{LF}got scattered around again.
That's terrible.{LF}But I'm just glad that {LF}you didn't get hurt, Yue.
Well...I was thinking I ought to {LF}close my store for the day, but since{LF}you're here, maybe I can keep it open{LF}just a little longer.
Wow. Even now, you're still {LF}thinking about your business.
It's the end of another year.{LF}Did you get everything done{LF}that you wanted to do this year?
Yeah, I think I have, I guess... 
Weren't you talking about how you{LF}wanted to buy one of everything{LF}from my store by the year's end?
(Is it just me, or has she{LF}gotten a lot more pushy lately?)
The cherry blossoms are beautiful.{LF}I love how peaceful it is in the spring.
It's gotten hot out lately,{LF}but I'm not going to let that stop me!
It's fall already.{LF}If I go to the mountains,{LF}I can collect a lot of things to sell.
Merchants can't give up in the winter{LF}just because it's cold out!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠, how do you{LF}like this town?
Well, I think everyone's pretty{LF}friendly, and it's a nice place{LF}to live.
That's good! This isn't my{LF}hometown, but I'm glad you{LF}like it. I like it, too!
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think?{LF}How do you like this town?
Everyone's nice, and it's a{LF}comfortable place to live.
Ha ha ha! {LF}I like it here too.{LF}That's why I come by so often.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}this is a nice town, don't you think?
Yeah, everyone's nice, and it's a{LF}comfortable place to live.
Ha ha ha!{LF}I have to visit a lot of towns,{LF}but I really like this one.
I have to start business{LF}bright and early!{LF}Do you want to be my first customer{LF}of the day, ＠カイル＠＠?
Oh, yeah, I came to look at{LF}what you have for sale.
Alright. Well, look all you want!
Did you come by to look at my{LF}store in your free time?
Oh, yeah, I just thought I'd stop by.
If you see something you want,{LF}you should treat yourself to it!
It's nighttime already...{LF}I wonder what I should eat tonight.
I worked hard today, and I'd{LF}better eat a lot of food if{LF}I want to get anything done tomorrow.
It takes a lot of energy to sell{LF}things all day, doesn't it?
It sure does.{LF}I have to walk around carrying{LF}all this stuff! It's not easy.
I couldn't ever turn down a good{LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I don't care how many I've eaten.
I couldn't ever turn down a good{LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I don't care how many I've eaten.
I couldn't ever turn down a good{LF}＠アイテム９＠.{LF}I don't care how many I've eaten.
I travel a lot, don't you think?{LF}I make friends wherever I go.
Gosh, Yue, you must{LF}have a lot of friends.
I guess I do.{LF}There are even people that consider{LF}me part of their own families.{LF}I'm very grateful.
I travel a lot, don't you think?{LF}I make friends wherever I go.
Gosh, Yue, you must{LF}have a lot of friends.
I guess I do.{LF}There are even people that will{LF}invite me over for dinner every{LF}time I visit. I'm very grateful.
I travel a lot, don't you think?{LF}I make friends wherever I go.
Gosh, Yue, you must{LF}have a lot of friends.
I guess I do.{LF}Some of them are pretty strange, though.{LF}It can be kind of annoying, sometimes.{LF}Ha ha ha ha.
I travel the whole world for my{LF}business. This country, Norad,{LF}is very peaceful, even though{LF}everyone around it is at war.
I never thought of it that way.{LF}It's almost a miracle.
I don't have enough lives to do{LF}business in places filled with gunfire.{LF}Lately, I've been staying inside Norad{LF}Kingdom, where it's safer.
I travel the whole world for my{LF}business. This country, Norad,{LF}is very peaceful, even though{LF}everyone around it is at war.
I never thought of it that way.{LF}It's almost a miracle.
I'd much rather do business where{LF}it's safe than somewhere dangerous.{LF}Lately, I've been staying inside Norad{LF}Kingdom where it's safer.
I travel the whole world for my{LF}business. This country, Norad,{LF}is very peaceful, even though{LF}everyone around it is at war.
You're amazing, Yue.{LF}You get to see all kinds of places.
I like being able to travel.{LF}It's a wonderful experience,{LF}and I get to see so many {LF}interesting things.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of my selection?{LF}If I'm missing something that you want, {LF}you can tell me, alright?
I like that you have valuable items.
I don't think it's a good selection.
Really?{LF}I'm glad that you like it.{LF}But flattery isn't going{LF}to get you anywhere.
I'll do my best to find better items.{LF}Try to forgive me if I have a bad day.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of my selection?{LF}If I'm missing something that you want, {LF}you can tell me, alright?
I like that you have rare items.
There's not a lot there that I want.
Really?{LF}I tried to find some{LF}good things this time.
I'm glad you said that.
I'm trying to find interesting things{LF}to sell, but the popular ones sell{LF}out quickly.{LF}Try to forgive me if I have a bad day.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}what do you think of my selection?{LF}If I'm missing something that you want, {LF}you can tell me, alright?
I like that you have valuable items.
I don't think it's a good selection.
I'm glad.{LF}I've been doing everything I can{LF}to find a nice selection of goods.
I'm looking forward to doing{LF}more business with you.
I'm sorry.{LF}I'm really trying my best.
Try to forgive me if I have a bad day.
I'm collecting{LF}＠アイテム８＠.{LF}If you find any,{LF}please let me have them.
I'm collecting{LF}＠アイテム８＠.{LF}If you find any,{LF}please let me have them.
I'm collecting{LF}＠アイテム８＠.{LF}If you find any,{LF}please let me have them.
What do you think of my clothes?
That's a very pretty pattern.{LF}I get the feeling that it's{LF}something very special.
It's called a kimono.{LF}It's a little hard to wear,{LF}but isn't it cute?
This dress is called a kimono.{LF}What do you think of it?
It's pretty, and it certainly{LF}stands out, doesn't it?{LF}I get the feeling that it's{LF}something very special.
It is!
There's kimono for men, too.{LF}I think you'd look good in one,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
This dress is called a kimono.{LF}It's unusual, isn't it?
Yes, I get the feeling that it's{LF}something very special.
It is!
It can fetch a fairly high price.{LF}That's all I care about, really.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know anything{LF}about where I'm from?
Hmm... What was it...?{LF}They've got those samurai swords, right?
Samurai swords? Yes, there are.{LF}Now that you mention it,{LF}every time I come in to town,{LF}Tanya asks me,
"Did you stock up on{LF}any samurai swords?"{LF}She really likes her{LF}weapons, doesn't she?
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know anything{LF}about where I'm from?
They've got those samurai swords, right?{LF}Tanya's always carrying one around.
You're right, she is!{LF}She's always bugging me about it.{LF}"Yue, did you bring me any samurai{LF}swords this time?"
She really likes her{LF}weapons, doesn't she?
Ha ha ha.{LF}That certainly sounds like her.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}do you know anything{LF}about where I'm from?
They've got those samurai swords, right?{LF}Tanya's always talking about them.
You're right, she is!{LF}They are supposed to be able to cut{LF}through anything. I think Tanya goes{LF}a little overboard with it, though...
Ha ha ha! How'd you know?
I can't stand ＠アイテム７＠.{LF}They're just so...tentacly. And gross.
I can't stand ＠アイテム７＠.{LF}They're just so...tentacly. And gross.
I can't stand ＠アイテム７＠.{LF}They're just so...tentacly. And gross.
My birthday is the 9th of Spring.{LF}Try to remember it.
I-I will.{LF}What do people do for birthdays{LF}where you're from?
Hmm... Well...
I guess we don't do much!{LF}Ha ha ha.
What's your birthday,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Um... Well...{LF}I don't really remember...
Oh, that's right.{LF}It must be hard not{LF}knowing your own birthday.
Here, I'll teach you mine.{LF}It's the 9th of Spring.{LF}Try to remember it.
What's your birthday,{LF}＠カイル＠＠?
Um... Well...{LF}I don't really remember...
You even forgot your own birthday?{LF}Here, let me teach you mine instead.{LF}It's the 9th of Spring.{LF}Try to remember it.
I know this is going to sound sudden,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, but...{LF}What do you think of me?
It's fun talking to you.
I don't really...
You make me feel so special!{LF}I like talking with you, too.
Really?{LF}You're mean, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You shouldn't talk like that!{LF}You're going to hurt someone's feelings.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠... Um...{LF}I was just wondering...{LF}What do you think of me?
It's fun talking to you.
I don't really...
Really?{LF}I'm glad you think so, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}That's the first time{LF}anyone's said that to me.
You're mean, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}That hurts...
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I know this is random,{LF}but what do you think of me?
It's fun talking to you.
I don't really...
I think... I like you.
Really?{LF}I'm glad you think so, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I enjoy talking with you too.
That's harsh, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I-I'm shocked.
R-Really? {LF}Where'd that come from, all of a sudden? {LF}You're making me blush... 
You work so hard every day, don't you?
I do what I can.
I'm working hard too.{LF}I'm not going to let{LF}you sell more than me!
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}How's your work coming along?
If you need something,{LF}you can let me know.
Y-Yeah, thanks, Yue.
I'll do everything I can to find it.{LF}You're my best customer, after all.
Hey, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Has my store been helpful to you?
Y-Yeah, it's been very helpful, Yue.
That's good.
You're my best customer, so if you{LF}ever need anything, be sure to tell me.
I don't want everyone to know it,{LF}but I'm not working just to make{LF}money for myself.
Really?{LF}Do you have some kind of secret{LF}that makes you travel from town to town?
Shhh!{LF}Keep your voice down,{LF}＠カイル＠＠!
I do have another reason...{LF}I like meeting lots of people.
What?!{LF}That's the most boring secret I've{LF}ever heard. What's the point in hiding{LF}something like that?
I know, that's exactly why{LF}I can't tell anyone!
I've noticed something.
What?{LF}What have you noticed?
I do business, right?{LF}Well, I started out because{LF}I wanted to make money.
But I haven't been making{LF}all that much money, really. {LF}Instead, I've just been {LF}doing a lot of hard work.
Shouldn't you have noticed{LF}that a little earlier?
Probably, but I think I'm{LF}suited to this line of work,{LF}I really do.{LF}It's too late to stop now.
I've noticed something.
What?{LF}What have you noticed?
I do business, right?{LF}Well, I started out because{LF}I wanted to make money.
But I haven't been making{LF}all that much money, really. {LF}Instead, I've just been {LF}doing a lot of hard work.
Shouldn't you have noticed{LF}that a little earlier?
Probably, but I think I'm{LF}suited to this line of work,{LF}and I do have a lot of fun.{LF}That's all that matters, right?
I'm so hot right now!{LF}It's unbearable to wear{LF}this kimono in the summer!
I'm so hot right now!{LF}It's unbearable to wear{LF}this kimono in the summer!
I'm so hot right now!{LF}It's unbearable to wear{LF}this kimono in the summer!
Have you thought about what{LF}you want to do in the future?{LF}Do you think you'll still {LF}want to be a farmer?
I haven't really decided yet.{LF}I'm happy working on my farm for now.
Really? I think I'll always{LF}be a merchant. I've never thought{LF}about trying a different job.
Have you thought about what{LF}you want to do in the future?{LF}Do you think you'll still {LF}want to be a farmer?
I haven't really decided yet.{LF}I'm happy working on my farm for now.
What would you think about going{LF}into business with me sometime?{LF}Let me know if you ever feel {LF}like giving it a try.
Do you think you'll always be a farmer?
I haven't really decided yet.{LF}I'm happy working on my farm for now.
I think it suits you.
I'm probably always going{LF}to be a merchant.
The items I sell are very hard to find.
Even getting them repaired{LF}can be a lot of trouble.
Yeah, you have a lot of great stuff.{LF}Where do you get it all, anyway?
I'd tell you how,{LF}but it's a trade secret.
The items I sell are very hard to find.
Even getting them repaired{LF}can be a lot of trouble.
Everything has to break sometime.{LF}I bet that can be pretty rough.
Yeah.{LF}But when I'm in trouble,{LF}the best thing to do is just run away.
I think you could end up{LF}worse off that way!
Nothing I've sold you has ever{LF}broken or anything, has it?
No... I haven't had any trouble.
That's good, because{LF}I sell a lot of rare items.{LF}If they broke it would be{LF}terribly hard to get them fixed.
Yeah, it sounds like it{LF}would be a lot of trouble.
But I think it's important{LF}that people be responsible.{LF}So if anything breaks, be{LF}sure to bring it back.
O-Oh, alright...
I'm always looking for new products,{LF}but lately I haven't been able to find{LF}anything that really jumps out at me.
There hasn't been anything that makes{LF}me stop and think, "Wow! What is this?"
Objects like that don't come{LF}around very often.
No, they don't.{LF}But nothing makes me happier{LF}than making a good find.
That's why I could never quit this job.
I'm always looking for new products,{LF}but lately I haven't been able to find{LF}anything that really jumps out at me.
What kind of things are{LF}you talking about?
Hmmm... It's hard to put in to words.
Pow!{LF}Wham!{LF}Jingle! Jingle!{LF}You know... That kind of feeling.
Ha ha ha.{LF}Well, that last one sounds like it{LF}could be money...
I'm always looking for new products,{LF}but lately I haven't been able to find{LF}anything that really jumps out at me.
What kind of things are{LF}you talking about?
Hmmm... It's hard to put in to words.
Pow!{LF}Wham!{LF}Jingle! Jingle!{LF}You know... That kind of feeling.
Ha ha ha.{LF}That last one sounds like it{LF}could be money...
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
No, not yet.
Yeah, sometimes.
You don't think about it?{LF}I guess that's pretty normal{LF}for a guy.
Really, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}I'm also getting to the age where{LF}I have to start thinking about it.
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I know this sounds sudden,{LF}but have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
No, not yet.
Yeah, sometimes.
Oh... Never mind.
Really, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Is there someone you're thinking of?
Hey ＠カイル＠＠,{LF}I know this sounds sudden,{LF}but have you ever thought{LF}about getting married?
No, not yet.
Yeah, sometimes.
Oh... Never mind.
Really, ＠カイル＠＠?{LF}Is there someone you're thinking of?{LF}Like, say...me?
Let me know if you see{LF}anything that's defective.
O-Oh, sure.{LF}I haven't had any problems yet.
That's good,{LF}but sometimes I've sold some things{LF}without knowing that they had defects.{LF}Ha ha ha.
Y-You should check before you sell it!
Let me know if you see{LF}anything that's defective.
O-Oh, sure.{LF}I haven't had any problems yet.
That's good,{LF}but sometimes I've sold some things{LF}without knowing that they had defects.{LF}Ha ha ha.
"Ha ha ha?"{LF}You're going to get yourself in trouble.
Let me know if you see{LF}anything that's defective.
O-Oh, sure.{LF}I haven't had any problems yet.
That's good, but sometimes I've sold{LF}some things without knowing that they{LF}had defects. Ha ha ha. So be sure to {LF}check before you buy anything.
If they're broken, you shouldn't{LF}display them in the first place!
Monsters live in the Forest of Beginnings,{LF}right? Whatever things they make would{LF}have to be pretty rugged, don't you{LF}think?{LF}
Well, it certainly sounds{LF}like there may be some unusual things.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}If you ever get a chance to go, {LF}would you get something for me?{LF}That's my only request.
If you insist, but{LF}that's only if I actually go.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}If you decide to go, {LF}let me know right away!
Sometimes I wonder what kind of place{LF}the Forest of Beginnings is.{LF}I think it must have lots of monsters {LF}and lots of strange items.
Well, it certainly sounds{LF}like it must be a pretty strange{LF}place.
I get the feeling I could get{LF}rich if I could get my hands{LF}on some items from there!
But how do you plan on getting{LF}to the Forest of Beginnings?
Well, you're going to go for me, {LF}＠カイル＠＠! You have to!{LF}It's no place for a sweet lil' ol'{LF}girl like me... 
Oh yeah, no problem...
Because they say{LF}there are so many monsters{LF}in the Forest of Beginnings!
If somebody like me went there,{LF}I'm sure I'd just get killed right away.{LF}It's such a scary place!
I guess I probably should{LF}stay away from there.
Yes, but don't you feel {LF}like it's your chance {LF}to get rich quick?
Aaah! I have a bad feeling about this.
＠カイル＠＠!{LF}Would you please go and {LF}check out the Forest of Beginnings?
Oh yeah, of course...
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you've been in the village a while. {LF}Is there anything you don't like?
Let's see...{LF}I can't really think of anything.
Me either.{LF}Anything I can't get here, I can {LF}get when I go to the other villages.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you've been in the village a while. {LF}Is there anything you don't like?
Let's see...{LF}I can't really think of anything.
If you have trouble getting something{LF}you need, just let me know, and I'll{LF}bring you anything you want.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}you've been in the village a while. {LF}Is there anything you don't like?
No, not really.
I'll bet there's something.
Wow, that's amazing!{LF}I've been to lots of places, but{LF}I've never seen one that's perfect.{LF}That's just the way the world is...
Oh, so there is!{LF}I bring things back from all kinds{LF}of different places...
But I guess it's not really{LF}very useful, is it?
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}it must be hard work {LF}everyday on the farm.
No, it's really pretty fun.{LF}Your work must be{LF}demanding, Yue.
Well, I suppose, but{LF}working with nature like you do{LF}must be so different to working{LF}with people like I do.
Yeah, I guess so.
There's no way I could ever do{LF}what you do, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I really admire you.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}it must be hard work {LF}everyday on the farm.
No, it's really pretty fun.{LF}But your work must {LF}really be demanding.
Well, I suppose, but{LF}working with nature like you do{LF}must be so different to working{LF}with people like I do.
Yeah, I guess so.
How about we swap jobs for a day?{LF}Don't you think that'd be fun?
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}it must be hard work {LF}everyday on the farm.
No, it's really pretty fun.{LF}But your work must be{LF}demanding, Yue.
Well, I suppose, but{LF}working with nature like you do{LF}must be so different to working{LF}with people like I do.
Yeah, I guess so.
You take care of the earth stuff, {LF}＠カイル＠＠. I'll take care of helping {LF}people with their relationships.{LF}Seems like a good balance.
＠カイル＠＠, {LF}have you heard of the {LF}Elder Dragons?
They're legendary dragons.{LF}Some may call them monsters, {LF}but in my hometown, {LF}we called them gods.
People say they're destructive, but{LF}really, they don't mean to do {LF}anything violent.
＠カイル＠＠, have you heard of the {LF}Elder Dragons? They're legendary{LF}dragons that have the power to{LF}destroy the world.
Sounds really frightening.
Yeah, but just imagine what one would{LF}be worth... Its teeth and scales would{LF}be worth a fortune, I bet!
It would probably be enough to live{LF}like a king for the rest of your life! {LF}I'd love to have one!
＠カイル＠＠, have you heard of the {LF}Elder Dragons? They're legendary{LF}dragons that have the power to{LF}destroy the world.
Sounds really frightening.
Well, these things always{LF}get exaggerated.{LF}But there's probably both truth {LF}and fiction to the story.
＠カイル＠＠, do you have minute?
What is it, Yue?
Well, I don't know, but...{LF}I'm really glad that I met you,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
I just really enjoy talking to you, and{LF}you always buy different things, 
and I just think you're a nice guy. {LF}Really. I really like spending time{LF}with you.
Heh heh! Thanks!{LF}I really enjoy your company too, Yue.
＠カイル＠＠, do you have minute?
What is it, Yue?

Now don't you go off to{LF}anyplace dangerous, okay?{LF}You're still just a kid, you know.
Are you enjoying school?{LF}Study hard and you'll grow up to {LF}be a fine adult.
This village has a lot more children {LF}than it used to! I think it's great!
Do you have some close friends?{LF}School isn't just for studying.{LF}It's a place to find friends, too.
When your father came to this village{LF}he worked in the fields and ran errands{LF}for people. He was a great man.
You may be little, but you're so reliable{LF}and level-headed, just like your father.
You've been going off to lots of places{LF}lately. You're not going near{LF}the dungeons, are you?
＠アルス＠＠, {LF}you look like you've{LF}changed lately. I think you're {LF}more muscular than before.
Monsters are very dangerous, so{LF}don't go near them, okay?{LF}Understand, ＠アルス＠＠?
They may say children are {LF}full of curiosity, so{LF}I don't want you going{LF}near the dungeons.
My, your face is suddenly starting to {LF}look so handsome and manly!{LF}Children certainly do grow up{LF}in the wink of an eye.
Your father came back!{LF}Oh, isn't it wonderful, ＠アルス＠＠?
I'm so glad ＠カイル＠＠'s back!{LF}I'm so happy for you, ＠アルス＠＠!
There's so many flowers blooming in {LF}spring. It just feels great, doesn't it?
Summer can be a tough season{LF}to walk outdoors in a kimono.
Even ordinary foods taste better in the {LF}fall, for some strange reason.
Everything is covered in snow outside!{LF}Walk carefully, or you might slip!

In spring, it's nice to do {LF}business outdoors.
It's a little hard to do business {LF}outdoors in the summer, though.
In the fall, it's so easy to spend your{LF}money on all the tasty food.
Doing business outdoors in the winter{LF}really takes a toll on you.

Aren't the cherry blossoms pretty?
In the summer, if I'm not careful{LF}sometimes bugs get in my kimono!{LF}Ooooh. It's so gross...
It's cooled off a little{LF}and feels nice out this time of year.
The snow is really deep in this village.
Be careful working in the fields{LF}or you could get hurt.
It's so cold out!{LF}Even so, children need to play{LF}outdoors in the fresh air!
Come home and rest {LF}when you get tired.
It's nice and warm inside the house.

This is a good place to {LF}escape to in winter.{LF}It's so warm.
I want to talk.
I want to go shopping.
I want a bargain.
Oh, never mind.
Oh, really?{LF}Come again soon.
The shore is so pleasant.{LF}But it's really uncomfortable {LF}when sand gets in my kimono.
This island would be a paradise{LF}if only there weren't any{LF}monsters.
I wonder what lies further inland?{LF}I'm interested, but the monsters {LF}are so scary, I could never go.
It's a little inconvenient that the only{LF}way to get to this island is by boat.

Children always have so much energy!{LF}I don't even want to {LF}move when it gets cold.

Chapter 1: About Weapons
Weapons are generally divided into{LF}six categories, each with their own{LF}special qualities. Choose the{LF}weapon that best suits your style.
One-handed swords
Two-handed swords
Next

Spears
Hammers
Next
Back to table of contents
Axes
Staves
Next
Back to table of contents
Overwhelm your enemies with a{LF}rapid series of attacks. You can also{LF}equip a shield to protect yourself.{LF}New warriors often pick this weapon.
Special Characteristics{LF}  Fast attack speed{LF}  Low attack power{LF}  Can be used with a shield
Larger swords that pack quite a punch.{LF}The blade length makes it easy to{LF}land blows. You can charge these{LF}swords for a faster special attack.{LF}
Special Characteristics{LF}  High attack power{LF}  Wide attack field{LF}  High critical hit rate
Spears deliver blows from a safe{LF}distance. It's hard to break through{LF}a barrage of spear thrusts.
Special Characteristics{LF}  Fairly high attack power{LF}  Very effective forward attack{LF}  Some improve defense if equipped
Fell your enemies with a single blow of{LF}unimaginable power. This is the hammer's{LF}specialty.
Special Characteristics{LF}  Extremely high attack power{LF}  Effective in knocking out foes{LF}  Good for repelling enemies
Axes slice your foes with a{LF}single blow. It's used like the{LF}hammer, but an axe has a higher {LF}critical hit rate.
Special Characteristics{LF}  Extremely high attack power{LF}  High rate of critical hits
Staves increase your magical powers.{LF}It's the best weapon for an{LF}aspiring conjurer.
Special Characteristics{LF}  Very low attack power{LF}  Increases wisdom{LF}  Increases spell potency
Chapter 2: About Rune Abilities
Rune abilities are special attacks{LF}that can be performed with your{LF}weapons. You must have a{LF}Skill Seal equipped to use them.
You can equip a Skill Seal by putting{LF}it in one of your Rune Ability slots.
There are countless rune abilities for{LF}different types of weapons. However,{LF}there are no rune abilities for staves.
Rune abilities can deliver a formidable{LF}blow regardless of your enemy's attack{LF}power. Use them when you're in a bind.
Chapter 3: About Magic
Spells can be used only after you have{LF}acquired the corresponding magic book.{LF}Two types of spells exist: offensive spells{LF}and recovery spells.{LF}
Chapter 4: About Attributes
Elemental attributes are divided into{LF}three opposing pairs: fire and water,{LF}wind and earth, and light and darkness.{LF}Attack an enemy with an attribute
opposite to that of your weapon or{LF}spell and your blow will be particularly{LF}powerful. But don't attack an enemy with{LF}its own attribute!

To attack, press the B Button with{LF}a weapon equipped. You'll attack{LF}in the direction that you're facing.
Pressing the B Button repeatedly will{LF}result in a chained attack. The maximum{LF}number of attacks that can be chained{LF}depends on the type of weapon equipped.
The number of attacks that can be{LF}chained for each type of weapon is as{LF}follows (you can't chain attacks with{LF}Hammers, Axes, or Rods):{LF}
One-handed swords: 4{LF}Two-handed swords: 2{LF}Spears: 3
If you hold down the B Button with a{LF}weapon equipped, your hand will start{LF}to glow. This means that you are {LF}charging up your attack.
You can then release the B Button to{LF}unleash a charged attack. Charged{LF}attacks are blows that deal massive{LF}damage. Don't be afraid to use them!
Occasionally a successful attack will{LF}yield a critical hit. In other words,{LF}you will deal more damage than{LF}usual.
Some weapons land critical hits more{LF}often than others. Try out as many{LF}different weapons as you can. Low{LF}attack power can be deceiving.
A successful hit will push your foes{LF}away from you. Spears and hammers{LF}are especially effective in repelling your{LF}adversaries. 
Small monsters are easy to knock back,{LF}Big monsters are hard to knock back.
Sometimes a successful attack will{LF}knock your opponent unconscious,{LF}giving you a brief opportunity to{LF}land a second blow.
You must do this quickly or your{LF}opponent will wake up.{LF}Hammers are particularly effective{LF}for knocking monsters out.
When knocking monster back, it is{LF}in your best interest to try knocking{LF}them against a wall.
If you do this successfully, your{LF}opponent will be unconscious for{LF}an extended period of time.
A backstep is done when you move{LF}backwards without changing the{LF}direction you are facing.
You can sometimes use this technique{LF}to avoid incoming attacks.
To perform a backstep, you must have{LF}shoes equipped as an accessory. You{LF}can also chain two backsteps together.
Executing a backstep is easy.{LF}First, move the +Control Pad in the{LF}direction you're facing, then move it{LF}in the opposite direction.
Both you and your opponents are{LF}vulnerable to attacks from behind.{LF}These attacks are particularly{LF}damaging.
Some monsters will specifically move{LF}around you and attack from behind.{LF}Be sure to pay attention.

Weapon Levels
Next
Back to table of contents
As your weapons level increases,{LF}the amount of RP consumed by swords,{LF}staves, and spears decreases.
You need to be especially careful{LF}when using heavier weapons. If{LF}your weapons level is low,{LF}they will consume your RP quickly.
You will have trouble fighting{LF}if you've used up all of your RP,{LF}so be sure to use an appropriate weapon{LF}for your weapons skill level.
If you use a hammer, your mining{LF}skill increases.{LF}If you use an axe, your logging{LF}skill increases.
You should exercise caution when using{LF}more powerful axes and hammers, as{LF}these decimate your RP if your skill{LF}level is too low.
Small hammers and axes are used{LF}for mining precious stones and turning{LF}trees into lumber, respectively. Their{LF}light weight makes them easy to handle.
If you temper these tools, you can{LF}increase their charge power, destructive{LF}power, and even the rate at which you{LF}find precious stones and gems.
Large hammers and axes cannot{LF}be used to clear boulders or tree stumps{LF}on your farm.
You can also craft weapons yourself,{LF}provided you built a forge. You're on{LF}your own in figuring out how to build{LF}one, so play around and figure it out.{LF}
Making strong weapons requires{LF}a high forging skill. Raise your{LF}skill level by making weapons.
Each individual weapon has a weapon{LF}level that influences its attack power.{LF}Be sure to compare weapon levels when{LF}you have two of the same weapon.
When forging your own weapons, high-{LF}level components yield high-level{LF}weapons
You can also use the forge to temper{LF}your weapons to increase their weapon{LF}level.

About Runes
About Status Ailments
Next
Back to table of contents
Taking on any monster one on one is{LF}not a particularly difficult task. You{LF}need to be careful, however, when taking{LF}on two or more opponents at once.
When you do engage multiple monsters{LF}at the same time, take them down one{LF}by one to avoid being surrounded.
You can tame monsters to fight for{LF}you. Fighting as a team is always more{LF}effective than fighting alone, so tame{LF}lots of monsters for your adventures.
If you raise your monsters' friendship{LF}level, they'll also grow more powerful!{LF}To raise their friendship level, make{LF}sure to brush them once a day.
If you get your hands on musical{LF}scores, you'll be able to exercise{LF}extra control over your monster{LF}companions.
Plus you'll be able to use your{LF}monsters to seek out special{LF}items hidden in dungeons.
Runes are balls of energy that protect{LF}Earthmates from natural dangers.{LF}Collecting them will restore your RP.
There are flowers and crystals that{LF}contain runes scattered throughout{LF}dungeons. Hit these with a hammer or{LF}sword to release runes.
When they're fully grown, crops will{LF}produce runes at a rate of one{LF}rune per day. You can also use the{LF}fields in dungeons to grow crops.
Try delaying your crop harvests{LF}to produce runes. This will soon become{LF}an indispensable part of your strategy{LF}for exploring dungeons.
Sometimes an enemy's attack will{LF}trigger a status ailment. When that{LF}happens, an icon will appear below{LF}your HP and RP gauges.
Touching the icon will cause the name{LF}of your ailment to appear. Use this to{LF}figure out what ailment you have!
Status ailments can be cured with a{LF}variety of magic and items. You can{LF}also receive treatment at Alvarna{LF}clinic.

My barn is full.
Looks like you found the ＠アイテム９＠.
I did.
And you did it without hurting a{LF}single monster... I knew I was{LF}right about you, ＠カイル＠＠.
What do you mean?
You seem like the type of person{LF}who is meant to tame the land and{LF}its monsters.
Those sort of people are called{LF}Earthmates. I think that you must{LF}have some of the qualities of an{LF}Earthmate.
Really? I don't really know much{LF}about that sort of stuff, but... 
Well I'm sure you've got the{LF}talent for it!
Here, take this ＠アイテム８＠. It's{LF}a present from me. You can use{LF}it to become even better friends{LF}with monsters.
You got the ＠アイテム８＠.
What is this?
It's a glove that will let you{LF}tame monsters.
If you equip it, you can pet a monster{LF}to show your affection for it. If you{LF}show it enough love, it'll become your{LF}friend.
That's amazing!
Well, you'll probably come under{LF}some pretty heavy fire while you're{LF}petting it, but...
Hahaha.
But if you show it love, everything will{LF}be fine in the end. Oh, but no matter{LF}how much love you show it, it won't{LF}befriend you unless you have a barn.
A barn?
It's the place where you keep the{LF}monsters that you tamed. You need{LF}Mayor Byron's permission in order{LF}to build one, though.
Try talking to him when he's in{LF}his office at his house.
Got it.
You'll also be needing wood if you{LF}plan on building a barn. Let me give{LF}you a head start on collecting it.
You got 100 pieces of wood
Thank you.

If you want to make friends with{LF}someone, try to talk to them every day.{LF}You can also give them presents!{LF}Taking part in the festivals will help, too.
Good advice. I'll remember that.
After you accept one of the requests,{LF}you'll need to talk to the person who{LF}made the request. The description of{LF}each request says who it's from.
If you're ever having trouble{LF}finding someone, you should go get{LF}a location reading from Alicia.
A location reading?
Alicia's fortunes don't usually{LF}come true, but her weather readings{LF}and location readings are{LF}always right. It's amazing.
Alicia is usually down by the docks,{LF}So if you ever need to find anyone,{LF}go see her. The docks are directly{LF}south of here.
Thanks!
Also, if you decide that you don't want{LF}to finish a certain request, go back{LF}to the bulletin board and select the{LF}same request again to cancel it.
Got it.
Who knows? You might even be{LF}getting a note from me!
Shall we dance, Mana?
I'd love to!
Thanks, Mana.{LF}I had fun.
I had a lot of fun too,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'll never forget it.
Me neither.

You danced really well.{LF}Thank you.
I'll never forget this.
I'm glad that you asked me to dance,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
See you later!
Shall we dance, Alicia?
(My reading was right!{LF}I did get asked to the dance!)
Did you say something?
What?{LF}Oh, no, it's nothing.
Thank you, Alicia.{LF}I had fun.
I did too.{LF}Thanks for asking me to dance with you.
Shall we dance, Dorothy?
I-I'll, um, try not to{LF}step on your toes...
Just relax and enjoy yourself.
O-Okay...
Thank you, Dorothy.{LF}You danced well.
Th-Thanks.{LF}Um... I had fun.
But...um...sorry you{LF}had to put up with me.{LF}I-I know I'm not a good dancer.{LF}
That's not true at all.{LF}You were wonderful.
Thanks, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}I'm glad you asked me to dance with you.
I'd better get going...
May I have this dance, Cecilia?
Yes, you may, ＠カイル＠＠.
Thank you, Cecilia.{LF}I had fun.
Me too.
Shall we dance, Rosalind?
Yes.{LF}Be gentle with me, alright?
Let's just have fun.
＠カイル＠＠, you're a good leader.
Dancing with you is easy.
We'll have to do this again sometime.
Of course! Whenever you'd like.
Ha ha ha.
I'll see you around.
Shall we dance, Yue?
I've got to warn you,{LF}I'm a terrible dancer.{LF}But we can have fun anyway, right?
Of course we can.
Thank you, Yue.{LF}That was nice.
Yeah, I had fun!
I didn't know you were{LF}going to be such a good dancer!
I've never really had much practice.
I had so much fun, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}You don't know how happy it{LF}made me to be asked to dance.
Thank you.
Well, I'll see you later,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Let's dance, Cammy.
Yeah!{LF}Let's dance!
You're a good dancer,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!{LF}

Let's dance, Roy.
Ha ha ha,{LF}I'll see what I can do.

It's my turn now!
I know, Sera.
Are you ready, Sera?
Yeah!
You're good at this,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
You're a good dancer, too.{LF}You really must be twins.{LF}You both dance exactly the same.
We do everything the same!
Cause we're twins!
I guess.
Well, I had fun.{LF}See you later.
I want to dance again next year!
Let's dance, Orland.
Sure...
Hmm...{LF}You're not half bad, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I didn't know you could dance.
Ha ha ha.{LF}You're not bad yourself.
Yeah, I'm alright.
Well, I'd better go now.{LF}See you around.
Let's dance, Leonel.
Yeah, let's do this.
Ha ha ha, I had fun,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're a good dancer.
Really?{LF}I thought you were good, too.{LF}I had fun.
Yeah, me too.{LF}Thanks!
I'll see you around,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
Let's dance, Leonel.
I'll do my best.
You're very good at this,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm surprised.
Ha ha ha.{LF}(It's because I secretly practiced.)
Thanks for dancing with me today.
I'd better get going.{LF}See you at school tomorrow!

You can take this boat to {LF}Blessia Island from here.
Feel free to use the boat{LF}whenever you like. But be{LF}careful! There are monsters{LF}on Blessia Island!
If you don't have a weapon,{LF}you should go buy one from{LF}Tanya's shop.
Also, if you want to sleep{LF}outside of the town, you'll{LF}want to have a sleeping bag.
You can't sleep outside without a{LF}sleeping bag! Luckily, we've got{LF}plenty in stock at our store!{LF}Pick up one or three before you go!
Um, okay...

Yeah, I'm still learning my way around.
Well, this is the way out of town.{LF}If you go right, you'll find the{LF}entrance to Trieste Forest.
Messhina Valley is to the left,{LF}and the Padova Mountains{LF}are straight ahead.
Also, you can't get to it from here,{LF}but if you go to the port in the{LF}south of town, you can get to{LF}Blessia Island.
Really? Great! Those sound{LF}like neat places!
No! There are monsters in all{LF}of those places! It's not safe{LF}like it is inside the town!
To put it bluntly, you won't be{LF}able to handle them with just{LF}your bare hands. You should go{LF}buy a weapon first!
Ah, okay! Thanks for{LF}the advice, Mana!

Hello, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}This is a barn.{LF}What do you think? Not bad, eh?
Yeah, it's really nice.
If you make friends with a monster{LF}using the Pet Glove, they will{LF}be transported here automatically.
You can have up to four monsters on{LF}each floor. For now, you have four{LF}floors, so that makes for a total of{LF}sixteen possible monsters.
That should be plenty for the time{LF}being.
You can take a monster with you, and you {LF}can even get some of them to help you on {LF}your farm. Just keep in mind that{LF}monsters aren't allowed inside the home.
Sounds good.
Also, don't forget to feed your{LF}monsters.
Do you see that hole to the left{LF}of the doorway? Your monster feed{LF}is stored in there.
If your monsters aren't being fed,{LF}they'll refuse to do any work for you.
You can check the sign to the right{LF}of the doorway to see information about{LF}the monsters inside.
You can use it to move monsters to{LF}another room, to confirm which monsters{LF}currently have work, or even to see{LF}which monsters have produce ready.
Got it.
Well, good luck.

       I do not know who I am{LF}{LF}        or where I came from.
I only know that I have been wandering,{LF}{LF}    searching for...something.
    But this town... Could this{LF}{LF} place be what I've been looking for?
Wow, this place is nice...
And these flowers are so{LF}beautiful...
Oh, hello!
Oh, um, hello...
Hey, I haven't seen you around here{LF}before. Are you just passing through?
Passing through?{LF}Um, I think so...
You think so? You mean you're{LF}not sure?
That's...one way to put it.
Ha ha ha!
Wow... How beautiful...
Oh, you really think so?{LF}Hee-hee. Thank you.
Uh, that tree, I mean. It's really{LF}pretty...
Ah, yes it is!
It's called a "cherry tree." They{LF}bloom with pink blossoms this{LF}time of year! That's one of the{LF}reasons I love coming here...
Yeah, I think I could get used to{LF}this place...
Really? That's great!
W-Watch out! It's an earthquake!
Mana!!! I am not going to let{LF}you marry him!!!
Father?! Marry? What are you{LF}talking about?!
You promised me that you'd{LF}stay my little girl forever!
Yeah, when I was six! Why are{LF}you even talking about this?!
Don't try to hide it! I overheard{LF}you two talking about love and{LF}feelings and that sorta stuff!
Father, we were talking about{LF}how much we love the flowers!
Oh, you were? Whew, that's a{LF}relief! Don't scare me like that,{LF}Mana!
You're the one who scared US!
I'm sorry about that... This is{LF}my father. I hope he didn't{LF}scare you too much...
It-It's okay!
Well, Mana, who is this fellow,{LF}anyway?
He says he's just passing{LF}through town.
It-It's nice to meet you, sir!
Just passing through town, eh? Well,{LF}you'd better hurry up and GET out{LF}of town before you get any funny{LF}ideas about marrying my daughter!
As long as there's breath in my{LF}lungs, I won't let anybody marry{LF}my little girl!
R-Right... I kinda gathered that...
Father! Will you be quiet?
Mana, it's only out of concern that I...
But you're embarrassing me!
Listen, I'm really sorry about all this...
No, don't worry about it...
I don't even know your name!{LF}I'm Mana, and this is my father,{LF}Douglas. And you are?
I'm... Well, I don't know how to{LF}say this, really, but I'm not sure{LF}WHO I am...
What?! Really? Why not?
I don't know! I can't remember{LF}who I am, or where I'm from...{LF}Nothing! But I felt like something{LF}was drawing me to this town...
Really? Well, I'm glad you ended up{LF}here! I guess you don't have any plans{LF}to go anywhere else, do you?
Um, not really, no...
Hey, Father, do you think we{LF}could lend him that farmland?
Hmm... Well, nobody's using it right{LF}now, anyway.
There's some farmland just inside{LF}the town! Would you like to use it?
What? But we only just met,{LF}and I couldn't possibly impose...
Oh, you wouldn't be! It's just going{LF}to waste right now. Really, I'd feel{LF}better if someone was living there.
Well, let me think about...
There ain't nothin' to think about!{LF}Mana's telling you to use it, boy!{LF}You'd better listen to what my{LF}daughter says!!!
Y-Yes, sir!
Father!
Sorry...
Sorry again about my father...{LF}But you really should use the{LF}farm!
Besides, my father and I run{LF}the general store. If you move{LF}into town and buy things, you'll{LF}be helping us, too!
Really? Well, if you insist...{LF}Sure, I'll use the farm!
Great! Here, let me show you{LF}the way... Oh! But first, we{LF}really need something to call{LF}you...
＠カイル＠＠, huh?{LF}That's a nice name!
Thanks!
All right, let's go! The farm is{LF}just to the east of here!
Just to the east of here. Got it.
I should probably follow her...
I should probably follow her...
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?
No, I just got here myself.
That's good.
It's pretty, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
This is the place where we first met.
Yeah, it is.
Just think, if I hadn't happened{LF}to come by at that very time...
If I hadn't wandered to this very{LF}town...
We never would have met.
Yeah.
(I'm glad I came here that day.)
Did you say something?
No, it's nothing.
Thanks for coming to look{LF}at the flowers with me today.{LF}See you around.
Yeah, I had fun.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?
No, I just got here myself.
That's good.{LF}Let's go under the cherry tree.
All right.
It's pretty!
Yes, it's very pretty.
The cherry tree is always in{LF}full bloom this time of year.
This tree is my first memory {LF}of this town. I couldn't take {LF}my eyes off of it.
Really?{LF}I guess it stands out, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
Well, I should be getting home.{LF}See you later!
All right. This was fun.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?{LF}According to my fortune,{LF}you should have just gotten here.
You're right, I haven't been here long.
I knew it!{LF}I'm a natural fortuneteller.
The cherry blossoms are pretty,{LF}aren't they?
Yeah, they are.
My fortune says that couples{LF}who go on a date here have{LF}a high chance of getting married.
Really?
It's true!{LF}And my fortunes are never wrong!
(I wonder if that's true...)
Thanks for inviting me out here today.{LF}I had a fun time.
Me too.
Talk to you later.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Did I make you wait long?
No, I just got here myself.
O-Oh, really?{LF}That's, um, good...{LF}Uh, do you want to go, you know,{LF}over to the cherry tree?
Sure.
It's so pretty...
Yes, it is, isn't it?
I love flowers...{LF}The, um, cherry blossoms, too...
They really are breathtaking.
Seeing them for the first time{LF}had a tremendous impact on me.
Yes, they, um, seem more...special{LF}than other flowers.
I know what you mean.
There's something about just{LF}looking at flowers that makes{LF}me feel so...peaceful...
Well, I should be getting home...
All right.
Thanks for inviting me out here...{LF}Goodbye, ＠カイル＠＠...
See you later.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?
No, I just got here myself.
That's good.{LF}Let's go look at the flowers.
The cherry blossoms are pretty,{LF}aren't they? I love looking at{LF}them like this.
I like this too.
You mean...being here...with me?
Oh, well, I was talking{LF}about the flowers.
Yes... Of course.
N-No, don't get me wrong,{LF}I like you too, Cecilia.{LF}Obviously.
Really?{LF}Thanks.
Yeah.
Thanks for inviting me out here today.{LF}It was a lot of fun.
I had fun, too.
See you around.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?
Hello, Rosalind.{LF}I just arrived here myself.
Shall we go look at the flowers?
Yes, let's do.
It's beautiful.{LF}It's so picturesque.
When I heard that this town had a custom{LF}of looking at flowers... It's not that I {LF}didn't believe it, exactly, but I just{LF}didn't understand what it was about.
But now, standing under this tree,{LF}I think I understand now.
Ha ha ha!
I couldn't count how many times I must{LF}walk right past this very spot. And I'm{LF}sure that I see this tree every time.
But only on the day of the festival{LF}do I really see its beauty.
I wonder why that is?
It's because I'm with you.
Oh, ＠カイル＠＠.
...
...
＠カイル＠＠?
Yes?
I don't think I'll ever forget{LF}being with you here today,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.
Me neither.
Ha ha ha!
Well, we'd better get going.
All right.
＠カイル＠＠,{LF}you'll ask me out again, won't you?
Of course!
Ha ha ha. Thank you.{LF}I'm going home now.{LF}Take care.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Sorry, ＠カイル＠＠.{LF}Were you waiting long?
No, I just got here myself.
Good. All right, let's go over{LF}to the cherry tree.
All right.
It's pretty!
It is, isn't it?
Don't you think the cherry blossoms{LF}have a special charm to them? They're{LF}just not like any other flower.
Yeah, I feel the same way.{LF}The first time I saw them,{LF}they took my breath away.
It's almost like a painting.
Yeah, it is.
Well, I'd better be getting back.{LF}Thanks for inviting me here,{LF}＠カイル＠＠.{LF}
Thanks for coming, Yue.{LF}I had fun.
See you!

      With that, winter changed to{LF}    spring, spring changed to summer,{LF}   summer to fall, and fall to winter.{LF}      And the cycle continued...
      Then, during one stormy night,{LF}          as spring came again,{LF}   and the flowers of the cherry trees{LF}         began to bloom anew...
Good morning, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}You're here early today.{LF}School hasn't started yet,{LF}you know.
Barrett! There's lots of magic{LF}that people don't know anything{LF}about, right?
Barrett! There's lots of magic{LF}that people don't know anything{LF}about, right?
Well, it is said that many of the{LF}powerful spells once used by the{LF}ancient Earthmates have been lost{LF}in the passage of time.
Do you know if they had any{LF}magic that could take them{LF}to the Forest of Beginnings{LF}and back?
Do you know if they had any{LF}magic that could take them{LF}to the Forest of Beginnings{LF}and back?
Yes, I believe they did.
Really? So it really exists!

Why are you asking, anyway?
Barrett! From now on, I'm going{LF}to study even harder!
Barrett! From now on, I'm going{LF}to study even harder!
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
You grown-ups say we should{LF}all have goals, right? {LF}Well, I've got a big new goal now.
You grownups say we should{LF}all have goals, right? Well,{LF}I've got a big new goal now!

Yes! That's why I'm going to{LF}study hard! I'm never going{LF}to give up!
Really... Well, that's the spirit, {LF}＠アルス＠＠. Glad to hear it.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Well, we got caught...
Yeah... But Barrett didn't seem{LF}that mad with us.
Yeah... But Barrett didn't seem{LF}that mad with us.
Well, we messed up today,{LF}so we'll just have to make sure {LF}nobody catches us next time!
What? Next time? Sorry, I'm done{LF}sneaking into buildings! He'll be{LF}furious at us next time if we get{LF}caught!
What? Next time? Sorry, I'm done{LF}sneaking into buildings! He'll be{LF}furious at us next time if we get{LF}caught!
That's the key: IF we get caught!{LF}Which won't happen next time!
Because you'll be helping out again,{LF}＠アルス＠＠!
N-No... No more sneaking around{LF}at night for me!
N-No... No more sneaking around{LF}at night for me!
Ha! Well, well see! Anyway, thanks{LF}for your help tonight, ＠アルス＠＠!
Yeah, it was pretty fun, I guess!
Yeah, it was pretty fun, I guess!
See you later, ＠アルス＠＠!
We got caught... Darn!
When he spotted us, I didn't know{LF}what to do!

(We're supposed to meet here.)
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Did I make you wait?
No, I just got here too.
No, I just got here too.
That's good.{LF}Let's go over to the tree!
It's pretty!
Yeah, it's very pretty!
You'll get yelled at if{LF}you try to climb it today.
I know, I know.{LF}But the same goes for you too,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
I'm not gonna climb it either.
Besides, we can do that anytime.{LF}Today, we should just have fun {LF}like everyone else.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's nice to just look at{LF}the cherry blossoms, the two of us.
Yeah, it is.
Thanks for asking me to come out here,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
It was fun, but I'd better get home.
Yeah, it was fun.
If there's anything else going on,{LF}you should invite me, okay?{LF}Bye, ＠アルス＠＠!
I will, Cammy.{LF}See you later!
(We're supposed to meet here.)
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Did I make you wait?
No, I just got here too.
That's good.{LF}Let's go stand over by the cherry tree.
Okay.
Ha ha ha, they're in full bloom.
Wow.
I love cherry trees when the{LF}flowers are in bloom.{LF}They're fun to climb.
You look at a tree,{LF}and that's all you can think about,{LF}isn't it?
You'll get yelled at if{LF}you try to climb it today, you know.
I won't do it today.{LF}I don't want to ruin{LF}everyone else's fun.
Even I know better than that.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's nice to take the time{LF}to just look at the cherry blossoms,{LF}the two of us.
Yeah.
That was fun, ＠アルス＠＠.{LF}I'm going to get going now.
Yeah, thanks for coming, Roy.
See you later!
Bye!
(We're supposed to meet here.)
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠!{LF}Did we make you wait?
You weren't waiting for us, we're you?
Let's go under the cherry tree!
Yeah!
Let's go!
It's pretty!
It's so pretty!
Yeah, it is. It really is.
This is kind of like a date,{LF}isn't it? Ha ha.
It's fun when the three of us{LF}go on a date.
Yeah, it is.
Well, we should get going now.
I don't want to go home yet,{LF}but I know Mom's worrying about us.
Yeah, we should get going.
Thanks for asking us out today.{LF}I had fun!
Me too!
Yeah, me too. Well, see you later.
(We're supposed to meet here.)
(We're supposed to meet here.)
I'm here now, ＠アルス＠＠.
Yeah, I just got here too, Orland.
I was worried that I made you wait.
Well, let's go over to the cherry tree.
It's in full bloom today.
It's pretty, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess so.
I love the cherry blossoms.{LF}Looking at them just makes me happy.
Really?{LF}They don't make me feel anything{LF}in particular.{LF}But I guess they're pretty.
Don't you think it's good to feel happy?
Yeah, I guess.
I'm not really that interested{LF}in flowers, but it's not like{LF}I hate them or anything.
Oh.
Well, what are you interested in,{LF}Orland?
I want to become more important{LF}than everyone else.{LF}If something can help me with that,{LF}then I'm interested in it.
That sounds like a lot of work.
What are you going to do{LF}when you're someone important?
...
It's better to be someone{LF}who's important rather than{LF}someone who's not.
Oh.{LF}Well, you've got a lot of work to do.
Since I'm studying a hundred{LF}times harder than you are.
Yeah, I know. I don't need you{LF}to tell me, ＠アルス＠＠.
Well, I'm going home now.{LF}I guess I had a little fun.
Yeah, thanks for coming here with me.
Yeah, thanks. Bye.
See you later!
(We're supposed to meet here.)
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.
Oh, Leonel. You came.
So do you want to go{LF}look at the flowers?
Yeah.
They're pretty!{LF}I love the cherry tree.
Ha ha ha, I like it too.
Leonel, aren't you going to{LF}try climbing the tree like{LF}Roy and the rest?
I'm not very good at it, so...
Oh.{LF}Well, I'm not really good at it either.
Really?{LF}I thought you were pretty good at it,{LF}＠アルス＠＠.
You shouldn't just make up things about{LF}me in your head, Leonel!
Ha ha ha, sorry.
Hey, ＠アルス＠＠.
What is it, Leonel?
Do you like spring?
Spring?{LF}Yeah, I like it.
Ha ha ha, me too.{LF}The weather starts to warm{LF}up and feel nice again.{LF}
Yeah, it does.
Sometimes, I'll doze off without{LF}even noticing it. Even when I'm{LF}outside. Even when I'm at school.
Ha ha ha, you could get{LF}in trouble for that.
Ha ha. Yeah, I'll have to be careful.
Well, we should probably get going.
Yeah, let's go.
See you later, ＠アルス＠＠!
Bye!
(We're supposed to meet here.)
(We're supposed to meet here.)
＠アルス＠＠!
Sorry I'm late.
No, it's all right. Let's get{LF}going.
I want to just jump right into{LF}all those branches drooping with{LF}flowers.
Hah, ＠アルス＠＠,{LF}you say weird things sometimes,{LF}you know that?
But don't you think it{LF}would be all fluffy?
Fluffy? Yeah, I guess it would.
Definitely fluffy.
All right! Some day, I'm going to{LF}dive right into all that{LF}fluffiness!
Ha ha ha. Sounds fun!{LF}Let me go with you when you do!
Of course!
Thanks!
Thank you for inviting me to join{LF}you out here, ＠アルス＠＠.
I feel like I'm getting to{LF}know you better.
Did you have fun?
Yes, I did.
I shouldn't bring my monster inside.
I'll get in trouble if I{LF}take my monster inside.

How do you know for sure?
Come on now, Barrett.{LF}Don't you think that other people have{LF}the right to believe in a higher{LF}power, even if you don't?
All right, let's say someone's{LF}being attacked, and they're too{LF}weak to defend themselves. Is your{LF}god gonna to step in and save them?
If you're as tough as you act, Barrett,{LF}why don't you just save 'em yourself?{LF}Ha ha ha!
Whatever. You're just avoiding my {LF}questions. I'm outta here.
Oh, um, hello, Barrett...
What?
Um... Well... Is-Is it...nice today?
Why don't you go outside and{LF}see for yourself?

Jake! I'm sorry, sir...{LF}Welcome to my inn.
"Sir"? He's just a human!{LF}You don't need to fawn over him!
Jake! You're being rude.{LF}Apologize to the man.
Aww...
Jake can be a handful. Well,{LF}I'm going over to the manor...
Have a good day, Ceci.
I shouldn't bring my monster inside.

Sorry I'm late, sir!
I've been waiting for you!{LF}I'm starving!
I want to eat a chicken omelet{LF}on rice, orcish style.{LF}And make it a large serving.
I'll have some elfish-style{LF}escargot, slightly on the tough{LF}side, and I'd like some orange{LF}tea before the meal.
I'll have...whatever is easy for{LF}you to make, Cecilia.
I'll get started right away.
Do they usually all order separate{LF}things? Rich people are such a pain!
Alicia, they'll hear you!
I don't care if they do!{LF}You must be quite the cook{LF}to handle all that at once.
I've gotten used to it, that's all.{LF}Did you need something today, Alicia?
I have a door-to-door fortune-telling{LF}service. Rosalind is one of my best{LF}customers, and I go where the money{LF}is!
There's nothing here.
Hey, it's the ＠アイテム９＠!{LF}I found it!

You have to fall to learn about pain.
*sobbing*...{LF}Huh? What do you mean?
It means that it's important{LF}to experience everything for yourself.{LF}Here, you should be fine now.
Thanks!
Wouldn't it be better if someone{LF}just explained it to you before you{LF}fell? I'd rather have it that way.
You'd be better off if you'd experience{LF}a little hardship yourself, young lady.{LF}Quit fooling around with that fortune-{LF}telling nonsense and get a real job.
Hmph! My fortune-telling{LF}is NOT nonsense!
Well, whatever it is, I{LF}don't accept it!
Sister, mother, why do you always have{LF}to be like this? Mother, can't you{LF}accept Alicia for who she is?
As a doctor, I cannot accept{LF}something that isn't based{LF}upon sound science and reason.
You're both as stubborn as ever.
I'm here... ＠カイル＠＠.
Good man, Roy.{LF}Let's go see Natalie.
Okay.
You came, Roy.{LF}That's big of you.
I promised ＠カイル＠＠{LF}that I would.
Good.{LF}It's important to keep your promises.{LF}A man is only as good as his word.
Yeah.
All right, I'm going to give {LF}you your shot now. Ready?
Y-Yes.
Here I go!
U-Urk... {LF}I-It doesn't hurt.{LF}It doesn't hurt!
All right, we're all done.{LF}You did well.
O-Of course! I'm a man!
And a fine young man at that.
R-Really?
Yes.{LF}Now, go on outside and play.
Ha ha ha!{LF}See you later!
Hard work is all well and good,{LF}＠カイル＠＠, but you{LF}need to take care of yourself.
It's okay to take a break if{LF}you need it. Don't overdo it!
I haven't seen you before.{LF}You worked too hard and fainted,{LF}but you should be fine now.
Hard work is all well and good,{LF}＠アルス＠＠, but you{LF}shouldn't work so hard that you{LF}end up fainting. All right?

Hey, kiddo.{LF}A real man would buy something{LF}nice and expensive right now!
Um, no, I'm not here to buy anything{LF}today...
What?! Do you think you can{LF}just waltz right in here and{LF}ask for my daughter's hand in{LF}marriage? I won't allow it!
Father! I'm sorry about him.{LF}Really.
N-No, don't worry about it...
Don't let him get to you.{LF}You're welcome here anytime!

Hey, is Cammy hiding in here?
No, I haven't seen her.{LF}Are you two playing hide-and-seek{LF}again?
Hah hah. You're sure?{LF}Hmm. I'd better take a look myself.
Hey, Roy, stop right there!{LF}You can't go into the women's bath.
Hmph. Next time I'll have to tell{LF}her that the bathhouse is off-limits.

Dinner? A meal feeds your{LF}belly for a few hours, but{LF}a sword like this can feed{LF}your soul for a lifetime!
What?! I don't even know{LF}what that means!
Come on! Aren't you glad{LF}you have a fun mother{LF}like me?

Wow, the school feels different{LF}at night...
Yeah, it feels kinda mysterious,{LF}doesn't it? But, somehow, that makes{LF}it feel like something exciting's{LF}gonna happen!
Well, let's go to the classroom!
Okay, open the door, ＠アルス＠＠.
Me? Why do I have to do it?{LF}Are you scared, Cammy?
Hey, a gentleman always opens{LF}a door for a lady, right?
Don't worry. It'll be fine!
Okay, I opened it!
It doesn't look like there's{LF}anyone around...
Let's go inside!
D-Don't go in without me!
We're in! Wow, the school really{LF}DOES feel strange at night...
That's because there's nobody around.
But... It's kinda creepy! It feels like{LF}something's gonna jump out at us!
I knew you'd be scared, Cammy!
I'm not scared! I just said it was kinda{LF}creepy! Are YOU scared, ＠アルス＠＠?
N-Not at all!
*WHAM*!

I can't believe I forgot my{LF}materials for class...
Hm? Why is this door open?{LF}Is someone here?
Oh no! It's Barrett!{LF}He's gonna catch us!

I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
What do you think you're doing,{LF}sneaking around here at night?
There's nothing wrong with having a{LF}healthy sense of curiosity, but prowling{LF}around the school in the middle of the{LF}night is taking it a bit too far.
*sigh*... I don't know what to do{LF}with you two... What the heck were{LF}you two even doing here?
We weren't doing anything! We{LF}just wanted to see what it would{LF}be like to go inside the school{LF}at night! Please believe us!
And you, ＠アルス＠＠?
I wasn't doing anything!{LF}It's just like Cammy said!
I wasn't doing anything!{LF}It's just like Cammy said!

If you two like school that much,{LF}I hope you'll start acting like it{LF}in class!
Yes, sir!

Sorry again, Barrett!
Yeah, sorry, Barrett!
Heh, we made it in!
Why are the lights still on?{LF}Is someone still here?
I can't believe we're doing this!{LF}It's so exciting!
Well, let's go to the classroom!
Go ahead, ＠アルス＠＠! Open the{LF}door!
Why do I have to? You're not scared,{LF}are you, Roy?
*pshhh*! No, of course not!{LF}Ladies first, that's all!
C'mon, it'll be fine!
There, I opened it.
It looks like nobody's around...
Let's go inside!
An empty classroom! It kinda feels{LF}strange, huh?
Well that was easy.
Yeah! This place feels really{LF}different at night!
Actually, it's kinda scary...
I knew you'd be scared, Roy!
J-Just a little!
WHAM!!!
W-What was that?!

Will you give it a try?

Don't let your guard down.
You must take after your father.{LF}Next, you'll be fighting nine monsters.
